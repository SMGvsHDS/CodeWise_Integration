# An AngularJS Style Guide for Closure Users at Google


## Background


This is the external version of a document that was primarily written for Google
    engineers. It describes a recommended style for AngularJS apps that use Closure, as used
    internally at Google. Members of the broader AngularJS community should feel free to apply
    (or not apply) these recommendations, as relevant to their own use cases.


This document describes style for AngularJS apps in google3. This guide
    supplements and extends theGoogle JavaScript Style Guide.


Style Note: Examples on the AngularJS external webpage, and many external apps, are
    written in a style that freely uses closures, favors functional inheritance, and does not often useJavaScript types. Google follows a more rigorous Javascript style to support JSCompiler
    optimizations and large code bases - see the javascript-style mailing list.
    This is not an Angular-specific issue, and is not discussed further in this style guide.
    (But if you want further reading:Martin Fowler on closures,much longer description, appendix A of theclosure bookhas a good description of inheritance patterns and why it prefers
    pseudoclassical,Javascript, the Good Partsas a counter.)


## 1 Angular Language Rules


### Manage dependencies with Closure's goog.require and goog.provide


Choose a namespace for your project, and use goog.provide and goog.require.


```javascript
goog.provide('hello.about.AboutCtrl');
goog.provide('hello.versions.Versions');
```


Why?Google BUILD rules integrate nicely with closure provide/require.


### Modules


Your main application module should be in your root client directory. A module should never be
    altered other than the one where it is defined.


Modules may either be defined in the same file as their components (this works well for a module
    that contains exactly one service) or in a separate file for wiring pieces together.


Why?A module should be consistent for anyone that wants to include it as a reusable component.
    If a module can mean different things depending on which files are included, it is not consistent.


### Modules should reference other modules using the Angular Module's "name" property


For example:


```javascript
// file submodulea.js:
  goog.provide('my.submoduleA');

  my.submoduleA = angular.module('my.submoduleA', []);
  // ...

// file app.js
  goog.require('my.submoduleA');

  Yes: my.application.module = angular.module('hello', [my.submoduleA.name]);
  
      No: my.application.module = angular.module('hello', ['my.submoduleA']);
```


Why?Using a property of my.submoduleA prevents Closure presubmit failures complaining that the file is
    required but never used. Using the .name property avoids duplicating strings.


### Use a common externs file


This maximally allows the JS compiler to enforce type safety in the presence of externally
    provided types from Angular, and means you don't have to worry about Angular vars being obfuscated
    in a confusing way.


Note to readers outside Google: the current externs file is located in an internal-to-Google
    directory, but an example can be found on githubhere.


### JSCompiler Flags


Reminder: According to the JS style guide, customer facing code must be compiled.


Recommended: Use the JSCompiler (the closure compiler that works with js_binary by
    default) and ANGULAR_COMPILER_FLAGS_FULL from //javascript/angular/build_defs/build_defs for
    your base flags.


Note - if you are using @export for methods, you will need to add the compiler flag


```
"--generate_exports",
```


If you are using @export for properties, you will need to add the flags:


```
"--generate_exports",
"--remove_unused_prototype_props_in_externs=false",
"--export_local_property_definitions",
```


### Controllers and Scopes


Controllers are classes. Methods should be defined on MyCtrl.prototype.


Google Angular applications should use the'controller as'style to export the controller
    onto the scope. This is fully implemented in Angular 1.2 and can be mimicked in pre-Angular 1.2
    builds.


Pre Angular 1.2, this looks like:


```javascript
/**
 * Home controller.
 *
 * @param {!angular.Scope} $scope
 * @constructor
 * @ngInject
 * @export
 */
hello.mainpage.HomeCtrl = function($scope) {
  /** @export */
  $scope.homeCtrl = this; // This is a bridge until Angular 1.2 controller-as

  /**
   * @type {string}
   * @export
   */
  this.myColor = 'blue';
};


/**
 * @param {number} a
 * @param {number} b
 * @export
 */
hello.mainpage.HomeCtrl.prototype.add = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
```


And the template:


```
<div ng-controller="hello.mainpage.HomeCtrl"/>
  <span ng-class="homeCtrl.myColor">I'm in a color!</span>
  <span>{{homeCtrl.add(5, 6)}}</span>
</div>
```


After Angular 1.2, this looks like:


```javascript
/**
 * Home controller.
 *
 * @constructor
 * @ngInject
 * @export
 */
hello.mainpage.HomeCtrl = function() {
  /**
   * @type {string}
   * @export
   */
  this.myColor = 'blue';
};


/**
 * @param {number} a
 * @param {number} b
 * @export
 */
hello.mainpage.HomeCtrl.prototype.add = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
```


If you are compiling with property renaming, expose properties and methods using the @export
    annotation. Remember to @export the constructor as well.


And in the template:


```
<div ng-controller="hello.mainpage.HomeCtrl as homeCtrl"/>
  <span ng-class="homeCtrl.myColor">I'm in a color!</span>
  <span>{{homeCtrl.add(5, 6)}}</span>
</div>
```


Why?Putting methods and properties directly onto the controller, instead of building up a scope
    object, fits better with the Google Closure class style. Additionally, using 'controller as'
    makes it obvious which controller you are accessing when multiple controllers apply to an element.
    Since there is always a '.' in the bindings, you don't have to worry about prototypal inheritance
    masking primitives.


### Directives


All DOM manipulation should be done inside directives. Directives should be kept small and use
    composition. Files defining directives should goog.provide a static function which returns the
    directive definition object.


```javascript
goog.provide('hello.pane.paneDirective');

/**
 * Description and usage
 * @return {angular.Directive} Directive definition object.
 */
hello.pane.paneDirective = function() {
  // ...
};
```


Exception: DOM manipulation may occur in services for DOM elements disconnected from the
    rest of the view, e.g. dialogs or keyboard shortcuts.


### Services


Services registered on the module withmodule.serviceare classes.
    Usemodule.serviceinstead ofmodule.providerormodule.factoryunless you need to do initialization beyond just creating a
    new instance of the class.


```javascript
/**
 * @param {!angular.$http} $http The Angular http service.
 * @constructor
 */
hello.request.Request = function($http) {
  /** @type {!angular.$http} */
  this.http_ = $http;
};

hello.request.Request.prototype.get = function() {/*...*/};
```


In the module:


```javascript
module.service('request', hello.request.Request);
```


## 2 Angular Style Rules


### Reserve $ for Angular properties and services


Do not use $ to prepend your own object properties and service identifiers. Consider this style
    of naming reserved by AngularJS and jQuery.


Yes:


```javascript
$scope.myModel = { value: 'foo' }
  myModule.service('myService', function() { /*...*/ });
  var MyCtrl = function($http) {this.http_ = $http;};
```


No:


```
$scope.$myModel = { value: 'foo' } // BAD
  $scope.myModel = { $value: 'foo' } // BAD
  myModule.service('$myService', function() { ... }); // BAD
  var MyCtrl = function($http) {this.$http_ = $http;}; // BAD
```


Why?It's useful to distinguish between Angular / jQuery builtins and things you add yourself.
    In addition, $ is not an acceptable character for variables names in the JS style guide.


### Custom elements


For custom elements (e.g.<ng-include src="template"></ng-include>), IE8
    requires special support (html5shiv-like hacks) to enable css styling.  Be aware of this
    restriction in apps targeting old versions of IE.


## 3 Angular Tips, Tricks, and Best Practices


These are not strict style guide rules, but are placed here as reference for folks getting
    started with Angular at Google.


### Testing


Angular is designed for test-driven development.


The recommended unit testing setup is Jasmine + Karma (though you could use closure tests
    or js_test)


Angular provides easy adapters to load modules and use the injector in Jasmine tests.moduleinject

- moduleinject
- inject

### Consider using the Best Practices for App Structure


Thisdirectory structure docdescribes how to structure your application with controllers in
    nested subdirectories and all components (e.g. services and directives) in a 'components' dir.


### Be aware of how scope inheritance works


SeeThe Nuances of Scope Prototypal Inheritance


### Use @ngInject for easy dependency injection compilation


This removes the need to addmyCtrl['$inject'] = ...to prevent minification from
    messing up Angular's dependency injection.


Usage:


```javascript
/**
 * My controller.
 * @param {!angular.$http} $http
 * @param {!my.app.myService} myService
 * @constructor
 * @export
 * @ngInject
 */
my.app.MyCtrl = function($http, myService) {
  //...
};
```
