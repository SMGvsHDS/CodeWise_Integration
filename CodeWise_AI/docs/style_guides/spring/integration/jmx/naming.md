Controlling
ObjectName
Instances for Your Beans
Behind the scenes, the
MBeanExporter
delegates to an implementation of the
ObjectNamingStrategy
to obtain an
ObjectName
instance for each of the beans it registers.
By default, the default implementation,
KeyNamingStrategy
uses the key of the
beans
Map
as the
ObjectName
. In addition, the
KeyNamingStrategy
can map the key
of the
beans
Map
to an entry in a
Properties
file (or files) to resolve the
ObjectName
. In addition to the
KeyNamingStrategy
, Spring provides two additional
ObjectNamingStrategy
implementations: the
IdentityNamingStrategy
(which builds an
ObjectName
based on the JVM identity of the bean) and the
MetadataNamingStrategy
(which
uses source-level metadata to obtain the
ObjectName
).
Reading
ObjectName
Instances from Properties
You can configure your own
KeyNamingStrategy
instance and configure it to read
ObjectName
instances from a
Properties
instance rather than use a bean key. The
KeyNamingStrategy
tries to locate an entry in the
Properties
with a key
that corresponds to the bean key. If no entry is found or if the
Properties
instance is
null
, the bean key itself is used.
The following code shows a sample configuration for the
KeyNamingStrategy
:
```
<
beans
>
<
bean
id
=
"exporter"
class
=
"org.springframework.jmx.export.MBeanExporter"
>
<
property
name
=
"beans"
>
<
map
>
<
entry
key
=
"testBean"
value-ref
=
"testBean"
/>
</
map
>
</
property
>
<
property
name
=
"namingStrategy"
ref
=
"namingStrategy"
/>
</
bean
>
<
bean
id
=
"testBean"
class
=
"org.springframework.jmx.JmxTestBean"
>
<
property
name
=
"name"
value
=
"TEST"
/>
<
property
name
=
"age"
value
=
"100"
/>
</
bean
>
<
bean
id
=
"namingStrategy"
class
=
"org.springframework.jmx.export.naming.KeyNamingStrategy"
>
<
property
name
=
"mappings"
>
<
props
>
<
prop
key
=
"testBean"
>
bean:name=testBean1
</
prop
>
</
props
>
</
property
>
<
property
name
=
"mappingLocations"
>
<
value
>
names1.properties,names2.properties
</
value
>
</
property
>
</
bean
>
</
beans
>
Copied!
```
The preceding example configures an instance of
KeyNamingStrategy
with a
Properties
instance that
is merged from the
Properties
instance defined by the mapping property and the
properties files located in the paths defined by the mappings property. In this
configuration, the
testBean
bean is given an
ObjectName
of
bean:name=testBean1
,
since this is the entry in the
Properties
instance that has a key corresponding to the
bean key.
If no entry in the
Properties
instance can be found, the bean key name is used as
the
ObjectName
.
Using
MetadataNamingStrategy
MetadataNamingStrategy
uses the
objectName
property of the
ManagedResource
attribute on each bean to create the
ObjectName
. The following code shows the
configuration for the
MetadataNamingStrategy
:
```
<
beans
>
<
bean
id
=
"exporter"
class
=
"org.springframework.jmx.export.MBeanExporter"
>
<
property
name
=
"beans"
>
<
map
>
<
entry
key
=
"testBean"
value-ref
=
"testBean"
/>
</
map
>
</
property
>
<
property
name
=
"namingStrategy"
ref
=
"namingStrategy"
/>
</
bean
>
<
bean
id
=
"testBean"
class
=
"org.springframework.jmx.JmxTestBean"
>
<
property
name
=
"name"
value
=
"TEST"
/>
<
property
name
=
"age"
value
=
"100"
/>
</
bean
>
<
bean
id
=
"namingStrategy"
class
=
"org.springframework.jmx.export.naming.MetadataNamingStrategy"
>
<
property
name
=
"attributeSource"
ref
=
"attributeSource"
/>
</
bean
>
<
bean
id
=
"attributeSource"
class
=
"org.springframework.jmx.export.annotation.AnnotationJmxAttributeSource"
/>
</
beans
>
Copied!
```
If no
objectName
has been provided for the
ManagedResource
attribute, an
ObjectName
is created with the following
format:
[fully-qualified-package-name]:type=[short-classname],name=[bean-name]
. For
example, the generated
ObjectName
for the following bean would be
com.example:type=MyClass,name=myBean
:
```
<
bean
id
=
"myBean"
class
=
"com.example.MyClass"
/>
Copied!
```
Configuring Annotation-based MBean Export
If you prefer to use
the annotation-based approach
to define
your management interfaces, a convenience subclass of
MBeanExporter
is available:
AnnotationMBeanExporter
. When defining an instance of this subclass, you no longer need the
namingStrategy
,
assembler
, and
attributeSource
configuration,
since it always uses standard Java annotation-based metadata (autodetection is
always enabled as well). In fact, rather than defining an
MBeanExporter
bean, an even
simpler syntax is supported by the
@EnableMBeanExport
@Configuration
annotation or the
<context:mbean-export/>
element as the following example shows:
Java
Kotlin
Xml
```
@Configuration
@EnableMBeanExport
public
class
JmxConfiguration
{
}
Copied!
```
```
@Configuration
@EnableMBeanExport
class
JmxConfiguration
Copied!
```
```
<
beans
xmlns
=
"http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
xmlns:xsi
=
"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xmlns:context
=
"http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
xsi:schemaLocation
=
"http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
https://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd"
>
<
context:mbean-export
/>
</
beans
>
Copied!
```
If necessary, you can provide a reference to a particular MBean
server
, and the
defaultDomain
attribute (a property of
AnnotationMBeanExporter
) accepts an alternate
value for the generated MBean
ObjectName
domains. This is used in place of the
fully qualified package name as described in the previous section on
MetadataNamingStrategy
, as the following example shows:
Java
Kotlin
Xml
```
@Configuration
@EnableMBeanExport
(server=
"myMBeanServer"
, defaultDomain=
"myDomain"
)
public
class
CustomJmxConfiguration
{
}
Copied!
```
```
@Configuration
@EnableMBeanExport(server=
"myMBeanServer"
, defaultDomain=
"myDomain"
)
class
CustomJmxConfiguration
Copied!
```
```

>
<

/>
</

>

Do not use interface-based AOP proxies in combination with autodetection of JMX
annotations in your bean classes. Interface-based proxies “hide” the target class, which
also hides the JMX-managed resource annotations. Hence, you should use target-class proxies in that
case (through setting the 'proxy-target-class' flag on
<aop:config/>
,
<tx:annotation-driven/>
and so on). Otherwise, your JMX beans might be silently ignored at
startup.
