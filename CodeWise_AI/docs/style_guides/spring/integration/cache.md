Cache Abstraction
Since version 3.1, the Spring Framework provides support for transparently adding caching to
an existing Spring application. Similar to the
transaction
support, the caching abstraction allows consistent use of various caching solutions with
minimal impact on the code.
In Spring Framework 4.1, the cache abstraction was significantly extended with support
for
JSR-107 annotations
and more customization options.
