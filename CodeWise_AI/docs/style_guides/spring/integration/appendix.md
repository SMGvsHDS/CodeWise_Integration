Appendix
XML Schemas
This part of the appendix lists XML schemas related to integration technologies.
The
jee
Schema
The
jee
elements deal with issues related to Jakarta EE (Enterprise Edition) configuration,
such as looking up a JNDI object and defining EJB references.
To use the elements in the
jee
schema, you need to have the following preamble at the top
of your Spring XML configuration file. The text in the following snippet references the
correct schema so that the elements in the
jee
namespace are available to you:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<jee:jndi-lookup/> (simple)
The following example shows how to use JNDI to look up a data source without the
jee
schema:
```
<
bean
id
=
"dataSource"
class
=

>
<
property
name
=
"jndiName"
value
=
"jdbc/MyDataSource"
/>
</
bean
>
<
bean
id
=
"userDao"
class
=
"com.foo.JdbcUserDao"
>
<!-- Spring will do the cast automatically (as usual) -->
<

name
=
"dataSource"
ref

The
jms
Schema
The
jms
elements deal with configuring JMS-related beans, such as Spring’s
Message Listener Containers
. These elements are detailed in the
section of the
JMS chapter
entitled
JMS Namespace Support
. See that chapter for full details on this support
and the
jms
elements themselves.
In the interest of completeness, to use the elements in the
jms
schema, you need to have
the following preamble at the top of your Spring XML configuration file. The text in the
following snippet references the correct schema so that the elements in the
jms
namespace
are available to you:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<
beans
xmlns
=
"http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
xmlns:xsi
=
"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xmlns:jms
=

</
beans
>
Copied!
```
Using
<context:mbean-export/>
This element is detailed in
Configuring Annotation-based MBean Export
.
The
cache
Schema
You can use the
cache
elements to enable support for Spring’s
@CacheEvict
,
@CachePut
,
and
@Caching
annotations. It it also supports declarative XML-based caching. See
Enabling Caching Annotations
and
Declarative XML-based Caching
for details.
To use the elements in the
cache
schema, you need to have the following preamble at the
top of your Spring XML configuration file. The text in the following snippet references
the correct schema so that the elements in the
cache
namespace are available to you:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
