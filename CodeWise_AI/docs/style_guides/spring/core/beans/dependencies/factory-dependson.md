Using
depends-on
If a bean is a dependency of another bean, that usually means that one bean is set as a
property of another. Typically you accomplish this with the
<ref/>
element
in XML-based metadata or through
autowiring
.
However, sometimes dependencies between beans are less direct. An example is when a static
initializer in a class needs to be triggered, such as for database driver registration.
The
depends-on
attribute or
@DependsOn
annotation can explicitly force one or more beans
to be initialized before the bean using this element is initialized. The following example
uses the
depends-on
attribute to express a dependency on a single bean:
```
<
bean
id
=
"beanOne"
class
=
"ExampleBean"
depends-on
=
"manager"
/>
<
bean
id
=
"manager"
class
=
"ManagerBean"
/>
Copied!
```
To express a dependency on multiple beans, supply a list of bean names as the value of
the
depends-on
attribute (commas, whitespace, and semicolons are valid
delimiters):
```
<
bean
id
=
"beanOne"
class
=
"ExampleBean"
depends-on
=
"manager,accountDao"
>
<
property
name
=
"manager"
ref
=
"manager"
/>
</
bean
>
<
bean
id
=
"manager"
class
=
"ManagerBean"
/>
<
bean
id
=
"accountDao"
class
=
"x.y.jdbc.JdbcAccountDao"
/>
Copied!
```
The
depends-on
attribute can specify both an initialization-time dependency and,
in the case of
singleton
beans only, a corresponding destruction-time dependency. Dependent beans that define a
depends-on
relationship with a given bean are destroyed first, prior to the given bean
itself being destroyed. Thus,
depends-on
can also control shutdown order.
