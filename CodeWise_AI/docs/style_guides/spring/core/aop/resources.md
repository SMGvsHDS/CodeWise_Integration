Eclipse AspectJ
by Adrian Colyer et. al. (Addison-Wesley, 2005) provides a
comprehensive introduction and reference for the AspectJ language.
AspectJ in Action
, Second Edition by Ramnivas Laddad (Manning, 2009) comes highly
recommended. The focus of the book is on AspectJ, but a lot of general AOP themes are
explored (in some depth).
