@AspectJ support
@AspectJ refers to a style of declaring aspects as regular Java classes annotated with
annotations. The @AspectJ style was introduced by the
AspectJ project
as part of the AspectJ 5 release. Spring
interprets the same annotations as AspectJ 5, using a library supplied by AspectJ
for pointcut parsing and matching. The AOP runtime is still pure Spring AOP, though, and
there is no dependency on the AspectJ compiler or weaver.
Using the AspectJ compiler and weaver enables use of the full AspectJ language and
is discussed in
Using AspectJ with Spring Applications
.
