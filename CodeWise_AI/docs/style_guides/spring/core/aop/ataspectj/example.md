An AOP Example
Now that you have seen how all the constituent parts work, we can put them together to do
something useful.
The execution of business services can sometimes fail due to concurrency issues (for
example, a deadlock loser). If the operation is retried, it is likely to succeed
on the next try. For business services where it is appropriate to retry in such
conditions (idempotent operations that do not need to go back to the user for conflict
resolution), we want to transparently retry the operation to avoid the client seeing a
PessimisticLockingFailureException
. This is a requirement that clearly cuts across
multiple services in the service layer and, hence, is ideal for implementing through an
aspect.
Because we want to retry the operation, we need to use around advice so that we can
call
proceed
multiple times. The following listing shows the basic aspect implementation:
Java
Kotlin
```
@Aspect
public
class
ConcurrentOperationExecutor
implements
Ordered
{
private
static
final
int
DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES =
2
;
private
int
maxRetries = DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES;
private
int
order =
1
;
public
void
setMaxRetries
(
int
maxRetries)
{
this
.maxRetries = maxRetries;
}
public
int
getOrder
()
{
return
this
.order;
}
public
void
setOrder
(
int
order)
{
this
.order = order;
}
@Around
(
"com.xyz.CommonPointcuts.businessService()"
)
public
Object
doConcurrentOperation
(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp)
throws
Throwable
{
int
numAttempts =
0
;
PessimisticLockingFailureException lockFailureException;
do
{
numAttempts++;
try
{
return
pjp.proceed();
}
catch
(PessimisticLockingFailureException ex) {
lockFailureException = ex;
}
}
while
(numAttempts <=
this
.maxRetries);
throw
lockFailureException;
}
}
Copied!
```
```
@Aspect
class
ConcurrentOperationExecutor
:
Ordered {
companion
object
{
private
const
val
DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES =
2
}
var
maxRetries = DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES
private
var
order =
1
override
fun
getOrder
()
:
Int
{
return
this
.order
}
fun
setOrder
(order:
Int
)
{
this
.order = order
}
@Around(
"com.xyz.CommonPointcuts.businessService()"
)
fun
doConcurrentOperation
(pjp:
ProceedingJoinPoint
)
: Any {
var
numAttempts =
0
var
lockFailureException: PessimisticLockingFailureException?
do
{
numAttempts++
try
{
return
pjp.proceed()
}
catch
(ex: PessimisticLockingFailureException) {
lockFailureException = ex
}
}
while
(numAttempts <=
this
.maxRetries)
throw
lockFailureException!!
}
Copied!
```
@Around("com.xyz.CommonPointcuts.businessService()")
references the
businessService
named pointcut defined in
Sharing Named Pointcut Definitions
.
Note that the aspect implements the
Ordered
interface so that we can set the precedence of
the aspect higher than the transaction advice (we want a fresh transaction each time we
retry). The
maxRetries
and
order
properties are both configured by Spring. The
main action happens in the
doConcurrentOperation
around advice. Notice that, for the
moment, we apply the retry logic to each
businessService
. We try to proceed,
and if we fail with a
PessimisticLockingFailureException
, we try again, unless
we have exhausted all of our retry attempts.
The corresponding Spring configuration follows:
Java
Kotlin
Xml
```
@Configuration
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy
public
class
ApplicationConfiguration
{
@Bean
public
ConcurrentOperationExecutor
concurrentOperationExecutor
()
{
ConcurrentOperationExecutor executor =
new
ConcurrentOperationExecutor();
executor.setMaxRetries(
3
);
executor.setOrder(
100
);
return
executor;
}
}
Copied!
```
```
@Configuration
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy
class
ApplicationConfiguration
{
@Bean
fun
concurrentOperationExecutor
()
= ConcurrentOperationExecutor().apply {
maxRetries =
3
order =
100
}
}
Copied!
```
```

To refine the aspect so that it retries only idempotent operations, we might define the following
Idempotent
annotation:
Java
Kotlin
```
@Retention
(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
// marker annotation
public
@interface
Idempotent {
}
Copied!
```
```
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
// marker annotation
annotation
class
Idempotent
Copied!
```
We can then use the annotation to annotate the implementation of service operations. The change
to the aspect to retry only idempotent operations involves refining the pointcut
expression so that only
@Idempotent
operations match, as follows:
Java
Kotlin
```
@Around
(
"execution(* com.xyz..service.*.*(..)) && "
+
"@annotation(com.xyz.service.Idempotent)"
)
public
Object
doConcurrentOperation
(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp)
throws
Throwable
{
// ...
return
pjp.proceed(pjp.getArgs());
}
Copied!
```
```
@Around(
"execution(* com.xyz..service.*.*(..)) && "
+
"@annotation(com.xyz.service.Idempotent)"
)
fun
doConcurrentOperation
(pjp:
ProceedingJoinPoint
)
: Any? {
// ...
return
pjp.proceed(pjp.args)
}
Copied!
```
