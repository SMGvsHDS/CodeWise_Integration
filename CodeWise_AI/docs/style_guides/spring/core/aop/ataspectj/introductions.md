Introductions
Introductions (known as inter-type declarations in AspectJ) enable an aspect to declare
that advised objects implement a given interface, and to provide an implementation of
that interface on behalf of those objects.
You can make an introduction by using the
@DeclareParents
annotation. This annotation
is used to declare that matching types have a new parent (hence the name). For example,
given an interface named
UsageTracked
and an implementation of that interface named
DefaultUsageTracked
, the following aspect declares that all implementors of service
interfaces also implement the
UsageTracked
interface (for example, for statistics via JMX):
Java
Kotlin
```
@Aspect
public
class
UsageTracking
{
@DeclareParents
(value=
"com.xyz.service.*+"
, defaultImpl=DefaultUsageTracked
.
class
)
public
static
UsageTracked
mixin
;
@Before
(
"execution(* com.xyz..service.*.*(..)) && this(usageTracked)"
)
public
void
recordUsage
(UsageTracked usageTracked)
{
usageTracked.incrementUseCount();
}
}
Copied!
```
```
@Aspect
class
UsageTracking
{
companion
object
{
@DeclareParents(value =
"com.xyz.service.*+"
,
defaultImpl = DefaultUsageTracked::class)
lateinit
var
mixin: UsageTracked
}
@Before(
"execution(* com.xyz..service.*.*(..)) && this(usageTracked)"
)
fun
recordUsage
(usageTracked:
UsageTracked
)
{
usageTracked.incrementUseCount()
}
}
Copied!
```
The interface to be implemented is determined by the type of the annotated field. The
value
attribute of the
@DeclareParents
annotation is an AspectJ type pattern. Any
bean of a matching type implements the
UsageTracked
interface. Note that, in the
before advice of the preceding example, service beans can be directly used as
implementations of the
UsageTracked
interface. If accessing a bean programmatically,
you would write the following:
Java
Kotlin
```
UsageTracked usageTracked = context.getBean(
"myService"
, UsageTracked
.
class
)
;
Copied!
```
```
val
usageTracked = context.getBean<UsageTracked>(
"myService"
)
Copied!
```
