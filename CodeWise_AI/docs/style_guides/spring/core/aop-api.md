Spring AOP APIs
The previous chapter described the Spring’s support for AOP with @AspectJ and schema-based
aspect definitions. In this chapter, we discuss the lower-level Spring AOP APIs. For common
applications, we recommend the use of Spring AOP with AspectJ pointcuts as described in the
previous chapter.
