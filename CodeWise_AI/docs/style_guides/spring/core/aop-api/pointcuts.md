Pointcut API in Spring
This section describes how Spring handles the crucial pointcut concept.
Concepts
Spring’s pointcut model enables pointcut reuse independent of advice types. You can
target different advice with the same pointcut.
The
org.springframework.aop.Pointcut
interface is the central interface, used to
target advice to particular classes and methods. The complete interface follows:
```
public
interface
Pointcut
{
ClassFilter
getClassFilter
()
;
MethodMatcher
getMethodMatcher
()
;
}
Copied!
```
Splitting the
Pointcut
interface into two parts allows reuse of class and method
matching parts and fine-grained composition operations (such as performing a “union”
with another method matcher).
The
ClassFilter
interface is used to restrict the pointcut to a given set of target
classes. If the
matches()
method always returns true, all target classes are
matched. The following listing shows the
ClassFilter
interface definition:
```
public
interface
ClassFilter
{
boolean
matches
(Class clazz)
;
}
Copied!
```
The
MethodMatcher
interface is normally more important. The complete interface follows:
```
public
interface
MethodMatcher
{
boolean
matches
(Method m, Class<?> targetClass)
;
boolean
isRuntime
()
;
boolean
matches
(Method m, Class<?> targetClass, Object... args)
;
}
Copied!
```
The
matches(Method, Class)
method is used to test whether this pointcut ever
matches a given method on a target class. This evaluation can be performed when an AOP
proxy is created to avoid the need for a test on every method invocation. If the
two-argument
matches
method returns
true
for a given method, and the
isRuntime()
method for the MethodMatcher returns
true
, the three-argument matches method is
invoked on every method invocation. This lets a pointcut look at the arguments passed
to the method invocation immediately before the target advice starts.
Most
MethodMatcher
implementations are static, meaning that their
isRuntime()
method
returns
false
. In this case, the three-argument
matches
method is never invoked.
If possible, try to make pointcuts static, allowing the AOP framework to cache the
results of pointcut evaluation when an AOP proxy is created.
Operations on Pointcuts
Spring supports operations (notably, union and intersection) on pointcuts.
Union means the methods that either pointcut matches.
Intersection means the methods that both pointcuts match.
Union is usually more useful.
You can compose pointcuts by using the static methods in the
org.springframework.aop.support.Pointcuts
class or by using the
ComposablePointcut
class in the same package. However, using AspectJ pointcut
expressions is usually a simpler approach.
AspectJ Expression Pointcuts
Since 2.0, the most important type of pointcut used by Spring is
org.springframework.aop.aspectj.AspectJExpressionPointcut
. This is a pointcut that
uses an AspectJ-supplied library to parse an AspectJ pointcut expression string.
See the
previous chapter
for a discussion of supported AspectJ pointcut primitives.
Convenience Pointcut Implementations
Spring provides several convenient pointcut implementations. You can use some of them
directly; others are intended to be subclassed in application-specific pointcuts.
Static Pointcuts
Static pointcuts are based on the method and the target class and cannot take into account
the method’s arguments. Static pointcuts suffice — and are best — for most usages.
Spring can evaluate a static pointcut only once, when a method is first invoked.
After that, there is no need to evaluate the pointcut again with each method invocation.
The rest of this section describes some of the static pointcut implementations that are
included with Spring.
Regular Expression Pointcuts
One obvious way to specify static pointcuts is regular expressions. Several AOP
frameworks besides Spring make this possible.
org.springframework.aop.support.JdkRegexpMethodPointcut
is a generic regular
expression pointcut that uses the regular expression support in the JDK.
With the
JdkRegexpMethodPointcut
class, you can provide a list of pattern strings.
If any of these is a match, the pointcut evaluates to
true
. (As a consequence,
the resulting pointcut is effectively the union of the specified patterns.)
The following example shows how to use
JdkRegexpMethodPointcut
:
Java
Kotlin
Xml
```
@Configuration
public
class
JdkRegexpConfiguration
{
@Bean
public
JdkRegexpMethodPointcut
settersAndAbsquatulatePointcut
()
{
JdkRegexpMethodPointcut pointcut =
new
JdkRegexpMethodPointcut();
pointcut.setPatterns(
".*set.*"
,
".*absquatulate"
);
return
pointcut;
}
}
Copied!
```
```
@Configuration
class
JdkRegexpConfiguration
{
@Bean
fun
settersAndAbsquatulatePointcut
()
= JdkRegexpMethodPointcut().apply {
setPatterns(
".*set.*"
,
".*absquatulate"
)
}
}
Copied!
```
```
<
bean
id
=
"settersAndAbsquatulatePointcut"
class
=
"org.springframework.aop.support.JdkRegexpMethodPointcut"
>
<
property
name
=
"patterns"
>
<
list
>
<
value
>
.*set.*
</
value
>
<
value
>
.*absquatulate
</
value
>
</
list
>
</
property
>
</
bean
>
Copied!
```
Spring provides a convenience class named
RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor
, which lets us
also reference an
Advice
(remember that an
Advice
can be an interceptor, before advice,
throws advice, and others). Behind the scenes, Spring uses a
JdkRegexpMethodPointcut
.
Using
RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor
simplifies wiring, as the one bean encapsulates both
pointcut and advice, as the following example shows:
Java
Kotlin
Xml
```
@Configuration
public
class
RegexpConfiguration
{
@Bean
public
RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor
settersAndAbsquatulateAdvisor
(Advice beanNameOfAopAllianceInterceptor)
{
RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor advisor =
new
RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor();
advisor.setAdvice(beanNameOfAopAllianceInterceptor);
advisor.setPatterns(
".*set.*"
,
".*absquatulate"
);
return
advisor;
}
}
Copied!
```
```
@Configuration
class
RegexpConfiguration
{
@Bean
fun
settersAndAbsquatulateAdvisor
(beanNameOfAopAllianceInterceptor:
Advice
)
= RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor().apply {
advice = beanNameOfAopAllianceInterceptor
setPatterns(
".*set.*"
,
".*absquatulate"
)
}
}
Copied!
```
```
<
bean
id
=
"settersAndAbsquatulateAdvisor"
class
=
"org.springframework.aop.support.RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor"
>
<
property
name
=
"advice"
>
<
ref
bean
=
"beanNameOfAopAllianceInterceptor"
/>
</
property
>
<
property
name
=
"patterns"
>
<
list
>
<
value
>
.*set.*
</
value
>
<
value
>
.*absquatulate
</
value
>
</
list
>
</
property
>
</
bean
>
Copied!
```
You can use
RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor
with any
Advice
type.
Attribute-driven Pointcuts
An important type of static pointcut is a metadata-driven pointcut. This uses the
values of metadata attributes (typically, source-level metadata).
Dynamic pointcuts
Dynamic pointcuts are costlier to evaluate than static pointcuts. They take into account
method arguments as well as static information. This means that they must be
evaluated with every method invocation and that the result cannot be cached, as arguments will
vary.
The main example is the
control flow
pointcut.
Control Flow Pointcuts
Spring control flow pointcuts are conceptually similar to AspectJ
cflow
pointcuts,
although less powerful. (There is currently no way to specify that a pointcut runs
below a join point matched by another pointcut.) A control flow pointcut matches the
current call stack. For example, it might fire if the join point was invoked by a method
in the
com.mycompany.web
package or by the
SomeCaller
class. Control flow pointcuts
are specified by using the
org.springframework.aop.support.ControlFlowPointcut
class.
Control flow pointcuts are significantly more expensive to evaluate at runtime than even
other dynamic pointcuts. In Java 1.4, the cost is about five times that of other dynamic
pointcuts.
Pointcut Superclasses
Spring provides useful pointcut superclasses to help you to implement your own pointcuts.
Because static pointcuts are most useful, you should probably subclass
StaticMethodMatcherPointcut
. This requires implementing only one
abstract method (although you can override other methods to customize behavior). The
following example shows how to subclass
StaticMethodMatcherPointcut
:
Java
Kotlin
```
class
TestStaticPointcut
extends
StaticMethodMatcherPointcut
{
public
boolean
matches
(Method m, Class targetClass)
{
// return true if custom criteria match
}
}
Copied!
```
```
class
TestStaticPointcut
:
StaticMethodMatcherPointcut
() {
override
fun
matches
(method:
Method
, targetClass:
Class
<*>)
:
Boolean
{
// return true if custom criteria match
}
}
Copied!
```
There are also superclasses for dynamic pointcuts.
You can use custom pointcuts with any advice type.
Custom Pointcuts
Because pointcuts in Spring AOP are Java classes rather than language features (as in
AspectJ), you can declare custom pointcuts, whether static or dynamic. Custom
pointcuts in Spring can be arbitrarily complex. However, we recommend using the AspectJ pointcut
expression language, if you can.
Later versions of Spring may offer support for “semantic pointcuts” as offered by JAC — for example, “all methods that change instance variables in the target object.”
