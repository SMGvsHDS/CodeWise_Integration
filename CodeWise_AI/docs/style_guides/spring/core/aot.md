Ahead of Time Optimizations
This chapter covers Spring’s Ahead of Time (AOT) optimizations.
For AOT support specific to integration tests, see
Ahead of Time Support for Tests
.
Introduction to Ahead of Time Optimizations
Spring’s support for AOT optimizations is meant to inspect an
ApplicationContext
at build time and apply decisions and discovery logic that usually happens at runtime.
Doing so allows building an application startup arrangement that is more straightforward and focused on a fixed set of features based mainly on the classpath and the
Environment
.
Applying such optimizations early implies the following restrictions:
The classpath is fixed and fully defined at build time.
The beans defined in your application cannot change at runtime, meaning:
@Profile
, in particular profile-specific configuration, needs to be chosen at build time and is automatically enabled at runtime when AOT is enabled.
Environment
properties that impact the presence of a bean (
@Conditional
) are only considered at build time.
Bean definitions with instance suppliers (lambdas or method references) cannot be transformed ahead of time.
Beans registered as singletons (using
registerSingleton
, typically from
ConfigurableListableBeanFactory
) cannot be transformed ahead of time either.
As we cannot rely on the instance, make sure that the bean type is as precise as
possible.
See also the
Best Practices
section.
When these restrictions are in place, it becomes possible to perform ahead-of-time processing at build time and generate additional assets.
A Spring AOT processed application typically generates:
Java source code
Bytecode (usually for dynamic proxies)
RuntimeHints
for the use of reflection, resource loading, serialization, and JDK proxies
At the moment, AOT is focused on allowing Spring applications to be deployed as native images using GraalVM.
We intend to support more JVM-based use cases in future generations.
AOT Engine Overview
The entry point of the AOT engine for processing an
ApplicationContext
is
ApplicationContextAotGenerator
. It takes care of the following steps, based on a
GenericApplicationContext
that represents the application to optimize and a
GenerationContext
:
Refresh an
ApplicationContext
for AOT processing. Contrary to a traditional refresh, this version only creates bean definitions, not bean instances.
Invoke the available
BeanFactoryInitializationAotProcessor
implementations and apply their contributions against the
GenerationContext
.
For instance, a core implementation iterates over all candidate bean definitions and generates the necessary code to restore the state of the
BeanFactory
.
Once this process completes, the
GenerationContext
will have been updated with the generated code, resources, and classes that are necessary for the application to run.
The
RuntimeHints
instance can also be used to generate the relevant GraalVM native image configuration files.
ApplicationContextAotGenerator#processAheadOfTime
returns the class name of the
ApplicationContextInitializer
entry point that allows the context to be started with AOT optimizations.
Those steps are covered in greater detail in the sections below.
Refresh for AOT Processing
Refresh for AOT processing is supported on all
GenericApplicationContext
implementations.
An application context is created with any number of entry points, usually in the form of
@Configuration
-annotated classes.
Let’s look at a basic example:
```
@Configuration
(proxyBeanMethods=
false
)
@ComponentScan
@Import
({DataSourceConfiguration
.
class
,
ContainerConfiguration
.
class
})
public
class
MyApplication
{
}
Copied!
```
Starting this application with the regular runtime involves a number of steps including classpath scanning, configuration class parsing, bean instantiation, and lifecycle callback handling.
Refresh for AOT processing only applies a subset of what happens with a
regular
refresh
.
AOT processing can be triggered as follows:
```
RuntimeHints hints =
new
RuntimeHints();
AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context =
new
AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();
context.register(MyApplication
.
class
)
;
context.refreshForAotProcessing(hints);
// ...
context.close();
Copied!
```
In this mode,
BeanFactoryPostProcessor
implementations
are invoked as usual.
This includes configuration class parsing, import selectors, classpath scanning, etc.
Such steps make sure that the
BeanRegistry
contains the relevant bean definitions for the application.
If bean definitions are guarded by conditions (such as
@Profile
), these are evaluated,
and bean definitions that don’t match their conditions are discarded at this stage.
If custom code needs to register extra beans programmatically, make sure that custom
registration code uses
BeanDefinitionRegistry
instead of
BeanFactory
as only bean
definitions are taken into account. A good pattern is to implement
ImportBeanDefinitionRegistrar
and register it via an
@Import
on one of your
configuration classes.
Because this mode does not actually create bean instances,
BeanPostProcessor
implementations are not invoked, except for specific variants that are relevant for AOT processing.
These are:
MergedBeanDefinitionPostProcessor
implementations post-process bean definitions to extract additional settings, such as
init
and
destroy
methods.
SmartInstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor
implementations determine a more precise bean type if necessary.
This makes sure to create any proxy that will be required at runtime.
Once this part completes, the
BeanFactory
contains the bean definitions that are necessary for the application to run. It does not trigger bean instantiation but allows the AOT engine to inspect the beans that will be created at runtime.
Bean Factory Initialization AOT Contributions
Components that want to participate in this step can implement the
BeanFactoryInitializationAotProcessor
interface.
Each implementation can return an AOT contribution, based on the state of the bean factory.
An AOT contribution is a component that contributes generated code which reproduces a particular behavior.
It can also contribute
RuntimeHints
to indicate the need for reflection, resource loading, serialization, or JDK proxies.
A
BeanFactoryInitializationAotProcessor
implementation can be registered in
META-INF/spring/aot.factories
with a key equal to the fully-qualified name of the interface.
The
BeanFactoryInitializationAotProcessor
interface can also be implemented directly by a bean.
In this mode, the bean provides an AOT contribution equivalent to the feature it provides with a regular runtime.
Consequently, such a bean is automatically excluded from the AOT-optimized context.
If a bean implements the
BeanFactoryInitializationAotProcessor
interface, the bean and
all
of its dependencies will be initialized during AOT processing.
We generally recommend that this interface is only implemented by infrastructure beans, such as a
BeanFactoryPostProcessor
, which have limited dependencies and are already initialized early in the bean factory lifecycle.
If such a bean is registered using an
@Bean
factory method, ensure the method is
static
so that its enclosing
@Configuration
class does not have to be initialized.
Bean Registration AOT Contributions
A core
BeanFactoryInitializationAotProcessor
implementation is responsible for collecting the necessary contributions for each candidate
BeanDefinition
.
It does so using a dedicated
BeanRegistrationAotProcessor
.
This interface is used as follows:
Implemented by a
BeanPostProcessor
bean, to replace its runtime behavior.
For instance
AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor
implements this interface to generate code that injects members annotated with
@Autowired
.
Implemented by a type registered in
META-INF/spring/aot.factories
with a key equal to the fully-qualified name of the interface.
Typically used when the bean definition needs to be tuned for specific features of the core framework.
If a bean implements the
BeanRegistrationAotProcessor
interface, the bean and
all
of its dependencies will be initialized during AOT processing.
We generally recommend that this interface is only implemented by infrastructure beans, such as a
BeanFactoryPostProcessor
, which have limited dependencies and are already initialized early in the bean factory lifecycle.
If such a bean is registered using an
@Bean
factory method, ensure the method is
static
so that its enclosing
@Configuration
class does not have to be initialized.
If no
BeanRegistrationAotProcessor
handles a particular registered bean, a default implementation processes it.
This is the default behavior, since tuning the generated code for a bean definition should be restricted to corner cases.
Taking our previous example, let’s assume that
DataSourceConfiguration
is as follows:
Java
Kotlin
```
@Configuration
(proxyBeanMethods =
false
)
public
class
DataSourceConfiguration
{
@Bean
public
SimpleDataSource
dataSource
()
{
return
new
SimpleDataSource();
}
}
Copied!
```
```
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
class
DataSourceConfiguration
{
@Bean
fun
dataSource
()
= SimpleDataSource()
}
Copied!
```
Kotlin class names with backticks that use invalid Java identifiers (not starting with a letter, containing spaces, etc.) are not supported.
Since there isn’t any particular condition on this class,
dataSourceConfiguration
and
dataSource
are identified as candidates.
The AOT engine will convert the configuration class above to code similar to the following:
Java
```
/**
* Bean definitions for {
@link
DataSourceConfiguration}
*/
@Generated
public
class
DataSourceConfiguration__BeanDefinitions
{
/**
* Get the bean definition for 'dataSourceConfiguration'
*/
public
static
BeanDefinition
getDataSourceConfigurationBeanDefinition
()
{
Class<?> beanType = DataSourceConfiguration
.
class
;
RootBeanDefinition beanDefinition =
new
RootBeanDefinition(beanType);
beanDefinition.setInstanceSupplier(DataSourceConfiguration::
new
);
return
beanDefinition;
}
/**
* Get the bean instance supplier for 'dataSource'.
*/
private
static
BeanInstanceSupplier<SimpleDataSource>
getDataSourceInstanceSupplier
()
{
return
BeanInstanceSupplier.<SimpleDataSource>forFactoryMethod(DataSourceConfiguration
.
class
, "
dataSource
")
.
withGenerator
((
registeredBean
) ->
registeredBean
.
getBeanFactory
().
getBean
(
DataSourceConfiguration
.
class
).
dataSource
())
;
}
/**
* Get the bean definition for 'dataSource'
*/
public
static
BeanDefinition
getDataSourceBeanDefinition
()
{
Class<?> beanType = SimpleDataSource
.
class
;
RootBeanDefinition beanDefinition =
new
RootBeanDefinition(beanType);
beanDefinition.setInstanceSupplier(getDataSourceInstanceSupplier());
return
beanDefinition;
}
}
Copied!
```
The exact code generated may differ depending on the exact nature of your bean definitions.
Each generated class is annotated with
org.springframework.aot.generate.Generated
to
identify them if they need to be excluded, for instance by static analysis tools.
The generated code above creates bean definitions equivalent to the
@Configuration
class, but in a direct way and without the use of reflection at all if possible.
There is a bean definition for
dataSourceConfiguration
and one for
dataSourceBean
.
When a
datasource
instance is required, a
BeanInstanceSupplier
is called.
This supplier invokes the
dataSource()
method on the
dataSourceConfiguration
bean.
Running with AOT Optimizations
AOT is a mandatory step to transform a Spring application to a native executable, so it
is automatically enabled when running within a native image. However it is also possible to use AOT optimizations
on the JVM by setting the
spring.aot.enabled
System property to
true
.
When AOT optimizations are included, some decisions that have been made at build time
are hard coded in the application setup. For instance, profiles that have been enabled at
build time are automatically enabled at runtime as well.
Best Practices
The AOT engine is designed to handle as many use cases as possible, with no code change in applications.
However, keep in mind that some optimizations are made at build time based on a static definition of the beans.
This section lists the best practices that make sure your application is ready for AOT.
Programmatic Bean Registration
The AOT engine takes care of the
@Configuration
model and any callback that might be
invoked as part of processing your configuration. If you need to register additional
beans programmatically, make sure to use a
BeanDefinitionRegistry
to register
bean definitions.
This can typically be done via a
BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor
. Note that, if it
is registered itself as a bean, it will be invoked again at runtime unless you make
sure to implement
BeanFactoryInitializationAotProcessor
as well. A more idiomatic
way is to implement
ImportBeanDefinitionRegistrar
and register it using
@Import
on
one of your configuration classes. This invokes your custom code as part of configuration
class parsing.
If you declare additional beans programmatically using a different callback, they are
likely not going to be handled by the AOT engine, and therefore no hints are going to be
generated for them. Depending on the environment, those beans may not be registered at
all. For instance, classpath scanning does not work in a native image as there is no
notion of a classpath. For cases like this, it is crucial that the scanning happens at
build time.
Expose the Most Precise Bean Type
While your application may interact with an interface that a bean implements, it is still very important to declare the most precise type.
The AOT engine performs additional checks on the bean type, such as detecting the presence of
@Autowired
members or lifecycle callback methods.
For
@Configuration
classes, make sure that the return type of an
@Bean
factory method is as precise as possible.
Consider the following example:
Java
Kotlin
```
@Configuration
(proxyBeanMethods =
false
)
public
class
UserConfiguration
{
@Bean
public
MyInterface
myInterface
()
{
return
new
MyImplementation();
}
}
Copied!
```
```
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
class
UserConfiguration
{
@Bean
fun
myInterface
()
: MyInterface = MyImplementation()
}
Copied!
```
In the example above, the declared type for the
myInterface
bean is
MyInterface
.
During AOT processing, none of the usual post-processing will take
MyImplementation
into account.
For instance, if there is an annotated handler method on
MyImplementation
that the context should register, it will not be detected during AOT processing.
The example above should therefore be rewritten as follows:
Java
Kotlin
```
@Configuration
(proxyBeanMethods =
false
)
public
class
UserConfiguration
{
@Bean
public
MyImplementation
myInterface
()
{
return
new
MyImplementation();
}
}
Copied!
```
```
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
class
UserConfiguration
{
@Bean
fun
myInterface
()
= MyImplementation()
}
Copied!
```
If you are registering bean definitions programmatically, consider using
RootBeanBefinition
as it allows to specify a
ResolvableType
that handles generics.
Avoid Multiple Constructors
The container is able to choose the most appropriate constructor to use based on several candidates.
However, relying on that is not a best practice, and flagging the preferred constructor with
@Autowired
if necessary is preferred.
In case you are working on a code base that you cannot modify, you can set the
preferredConstructors
attribute
on the related bean definition to indicate which constructor should be used.
Avoid Complex Data Structures for Constructor Parameters and Properties
When crafting a
RootBeanDefinition
programmatically, you are not constrained in terms of types that you can use.
For instance, you may have a custom
record
with several properties that your bean takes as a constructor argument.
While this works fine with the regular runtime, AOT does not know how to generate the code of your custom data structure.
A good rule of thumb is to keep in mind that bean definitions are an abstraction on top of several models.
Rather than using such structures, decomposing to simple types or referring to a bean that is built as such is recommended.
As a last resort, you can implement your own
org.springframework.aot.generate.ValueCodeGenerator$Delegate
.
To use it, register its fully-qualified name in
META-INF/spring/aot.factories
using
org.springframework.aot.generate.ValueCodeGenerator$Delegate
as the key.
Avoid Creating Beans with Custom Arguments
Spring AOT detects what needs to be done to create a bean and translates that into generated code that uses an instance supplier.
The container also supports creating a bean with
custom arguments
which can lead to several issues with AOT:
The custom arguments require dynamic introspection of a matching constructor or factory method.
Those arguments cannot be detected by AOT, so the necessary reflection hints will have to be provided manually.
By-passing the instance supplier means that all other optimizations after creation are skipped as well.
For instance, autowiring on fields and methods will be skipped as they are handled in the instance supplier.
Rather than having prototype-scoped beans created with custom arguments, we recommend a manual factory pattern where a bean is responsible for the creation of the instance.
Avoid Circular Dependencies
Certain use cases can result in circular dependencies between one or more beans. With the
regular runtime, it may be possible to wire those circular dependencies via
@Autowired
on setter methods or fields. However, an AOT-optimized context will fail to start with
explicit circular dependencies.
In an AOT-optimized application, you should therefore strive to avoid circular
dependencies. If that is not possible, you can use
@Lazy
injection points or
ObjectProvider
to lazily access or retrieve the necessary collaborating beans. See
this tip
for further information.
FactoryBean
FactoryBean
should be used with care as it introduces an intermediate layer in terms of bean type resolution that may not be conceptually necessary.
As a rule of thumb, if a
FactoryBean
instance does not hold long-term state and is not needed at a later point at runtime, it should be replaced by a regular
@Bean
factory method, possibly with a
FactoryBean
adapter layer on top (for declarative configuration purposes).
If your
FactoryBean
implementation does not resolve the object type (i.e.
T
), extra care is necessary.
Consider the following example:
Java
Kotlin
```
public
class
ClientFactoryBean
<
T
extends
AbstractClient
>
implements
FactoryBean
<
T
>
{
// ...
}
Copied!
```
```
class
ClientFactoryBean
<
T : AbstractClient
> :
FactoryBean
<
T
>
{
// ...
}
Copied!
```
A concrete client declaration should provide a resolved generic for the client, as shown in the following example:
Java
Kotlin
```
@Configuration
(proxyBeanMethods =
false
)
public
class
UserConfiguration
{
@Bean
public
ClientFactoryBean<MyClient>
myClient
()
{
return
new
ClientFactoryBean<>(...);
}
}
Copied!
```
```
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
class
UserConfiguration
{
@Bean
fun
myClient
()
= ClientFactoryBean<MyClient>(...)
}
Copied!
```
If a
FactoryBean
bean definition is registered programmatically, make sure to follow these steps:
Use
RootBeanDefinition
.
Set the
beanClass
to the
FactoryBean
class so that AOT knows that it is an intermediate layer.
Set the
ResolvableType
to a resolved generic, which makes sure the most precise type is exposed.
The following example showcases a basic definition:
Java
Kotlin
```
RootBeanDefinition beanDefinition =
new
RootBeanDefinition(ClientFactoryBean
.
class
)
;
beanDefinition.setTargetType(ResolvableType.forClassWithGenerics(ClientFactoryBean
.
class
,
MyClient
.
class
))
;
// ...
registry.registerBeanDefinition(
"myClient"
, beanDefinition);
Copied!
```
```
val
beanDefinition = RootBeanDefinition(ClientFactoryBean::
class
.
java
)
beanDefinition.setTargetType(ResolvableType.forClassWithGenerics(ClientFactoryBean::
class
.
java
,
MyClient::class.java));
// ...
registry.registerBeanDefinition(
"myClient"
, beanDefinition)
Copied!
```
JPA
The JPA persistence unit has to be known upfront for certain optimizations to apply. Consider the following basic example:
Java
Kotlin
```
@Bean
LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean
customDBEntityManagerFactory
(DataSource dataSource)
{
LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean factoryBean =
new
LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean();
factoryBean.setDataSource(dataSource);
factoryBean.setPackagesToScan(
"com.example.app"
);
return
factoryBean;
}
Copied!
```
```
@Bean
fun
customDBEntityManagerFactory
(dataSource:
DataSource
)
: LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean {
val
factoryBean = LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean()
factoryBean.dataSource = dataSource
factoryBean.setPackagesToScan(
"com.example.app"
)
return
factoryBean
}
Copied!
```
To ensure that entity scanning occurs ahead of time, a
PersistenceManagedTypes
bean must be declared and used by the
factory bean definition, as shown by the following example:
Java
Kotlin
```
@Bean
PersistenceManagedTypes
persistenceManagedTypes
(ResourceLoader resourceLoader)
{
return
new
PersistenceManagedTypesScanner(resourceLoader)
.scan(
"com.example.app"
);
}
@Bean
LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean
customDBEntityManagerFactory
(DataSource dataSource, PersistenceManagedTypes managedTypes)
{
LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean factoryBean =
new
LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean();
factoryBean.setDataSource(dataSource);
factoryBean.setManagedTypes(managedTypes);
return
factoryBean;
}
Copied!
```
```
@Bean
fun
persistenceManagedTypes
(resourceLoader:
ResourceLoader
)
: PersistenceManagedTypes {
return
PersistenceManagedTypesScanner(resourceLoader)
.scan(
"com.example.app"
)
}
@Bean
fun
customDBEntityManagerFactory
(dataSource:
DataSource
, managedTypes:
PersistenceManagedTypes
)
: LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean {
val
factoryBean = LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean()
factoryBean.dataSource = dataSource
factoryBean.setManagedTypes(managedTypes)
return
factoryBean
}
Copied!
```
Runtime Hints
Running an application as a native image requires additional information compared to a regular JVM runtime.
For instance, GraalVM needs to know ahead of time if a component uses reflection.
Similarly, classpath resources are not included in a native image unless specified explicitly.
Consequently, if the application needs to load a resource, it must be referenced from the corresponding GraalVM native image configuration file.
The
RuntimeHints
API collects the need for reflection, resource loading, serialization, and JDK proxies at runtime.
The following example makes sure that
config/app.properties
can be loaded from the classpath at runtime within a native image:
Java
Kotlin
```
runtimeHints.resources().registerPattern(
"config/app.properties"
);
Copied!
```
```
runtimeHints.resources().registerPattern(
"config/app.properties"
)
Copied!
```
A number of contracts are handled automatically during AOT processing.
For instance, the return type of a
@Controller
method is inspected, and relevant reflection hints are added if Spring detects that the type should be serialized (typically to JSON).
For cases that the core container cannot infer, you can register such hints programmatically.
A number of convenient annotations are also provided for common use cases.
@ImportRuntimeHints
RuntimeHintsRegistrar
implementations allow you to get a callback to the
RuntimeHints
instance managed by the
AOT engine. Implementations of this interface can be registered using
@ImportRuntimeHints
on any Spring bean or
@Bean
factory method.
RuntimeHintsRegistrar
implementations are
detected and invoked at build time.
```
import
java.util.Locale;
import
org.springframework.aot.hint.RuntimeHints;
import
org.springframework.aot.hint.RuntimeHintsRegistrar;
import
org.springframework.context.annotation.ImportRuntimeHints;
import
org.springframework.core.io.ClassPathResource;
import
org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
@Component
@ImportRuntimeHints
(SpellCheckService.SpellCheckServiceRuntimeHints
.
class
)
public
class
SpellCheckService
{
public
void
loadDictionary
(Locale locale)
{
ClassPathResource resource =
new
ClassPathResource(
"dicts/"
+ locale.getLanguage() +
".txt"
);
//...
}
static
class
SpellCheckServiceRuntimeHints
implements
RuntimeHintsRegistrar
{
@Override
public
void
registerHints
(RuntimeHints hints, ClassLoader classLoader)
{
hints.resources().registerPattern(
"dicts/*"
);
}
}
}
Copied!
```
If at all possible,
@ImportRuntimeHints
should be used as close as possible to the component that requires the hints.
This way, if the component is not contributed to the
BeanFactory
, the hints will not be contributed either.
It is also possible to register an implementation statically by adding an entry in
META-INF/spring/aot.factories
with a key equal to the fully-qualified name of the
RuntimeHintsRegistrar
interface.
@Reflective
@Reflective
provides an idiomatic way to flag the need for reflection on an annotated element.
For instance,
@EventListener
is meta-annotated with
@Reflective
since the underlying implementation invokes the annotated method using reflection.
Out-of-the-box, only Spring beans are considered, but you can opt-in for scanning using
@ReflectiveScan
. In the
example below, all types in the
com.example.app
package and its subpackages are
considered:
```
import
org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import
org.springframework.context.annotation.ReflectiveScan;
@Configuration
@ReflectiveScan
(
"com.example.app"
)
public
class
MyConfiguration
{
}
Copied!
```
Scanning happens during AOT processing, and the types in the target packages do not need to have a class-level annotation to be considered.
This performs a
deep scan
, and the presence of
@Reflective
, either directly or as a meta-annotation, is checked on types, fields, constructors, methods, and enclosed elements.
By default,
@Reflective
registers an invocation hint for the annotated element.
This can be tuned by specifying a custom
ReflectiveProcessor
implementation via the
@Reflective
annotation.
Library authors can reuse this annotation for their own purposes.
An example of such customization is covered in the next section.
@RegisterReflection
@RegisterReflection
is a specialization of
@Reflective
that provides a declarative way to register reflection for arbitrary types.
As a specialization of
@Reflective
,
@RegisterReflection
is also detected if you are using
@ReflectiveScan
.
In the following example, public constructors and public methods can be invoked via reflection on
AccountService
:
```
@Configuration
@RegisterReflection
(classes = AccountService
.
class
,
memberCategories
=
{ MemberCategory.INVOKE_PUBLIC_CONSTRUCTORS, MemberCategory.INVOKE_PUBLIC_METHODS })
class
MyConfiguration
{
}
Copied!
```
@RegisterReflection
can be applied to any target type at the class level, but it can also be applied directly to a method to better indicate where the hints are actually required.
@RegisterReflection
can be used as a meta-annotation to support more specific needs.
@RegisterReflectionForBinding
is a composed annotation that is meta-annotated with
@RegisterReflection
and registers the need for serializing arbitrary types.
A typical use case is the use of DTOs that the container cannot infer, such as using a web client within a method body.
The following example registers
Order
for serialization.
```
@Component
class
OrderService
{
@RegisterReflectionForBinding
(Order
.
class
)
public
void
process
(
Order
order
)
{
// ...
}
}
Copied!
```
This registers hints for constructors, fields, properties, and record components of
Order
.
Hints are also registered for types transitively used on properties and record components.
In other words, if
Order
exposes others types, hints are registered for those as well.
Runtime Hints for Convention-based Conversion
Although the core container provides built-in support for automatic conversion of many
common types (see
Spring Type Conversion
), some
conversions are supported via a convention-based algorithm that relies on reflection.
Specifically, if there is no explicit
Converter
registered with the
ConversionService
for a particular source → target type pair, the internal
ObjectToObjectConverter
will attempt to use conventions to convert a source object to a target type by delegating
to a method on the source object or to a static factory method or constructor on the
target type. Since this convention-based algorithm can be applied to arbitrary types at
runtime, the core container is not able to infer the runtime hints necessary to support
such reflection.
If you encounter convention-based conversion issues within a native image resulting from
lacking runtime hints, you can register the necessary hints programmatically. For
example, if your application requires a conversion from
java.time.Instant
to
java.sql.Timestamp
and relies on
ObjectToObjectConverter
to invoke
java.sql.Timestamp.from(Instant)
using reflection, you could implement a custom
RuntimeHintsRegitrar
to support this use case within a native image, as demonstrated in
the following example.
Java
```
public
class
TimestampConversionRuntimeHints
implements
RuntimeHintsRegistrar
{
public
void
registerHints
(RuntimeHints hints, ClassLoader classLoader)
{
ReflectionHints reflectionHints = hints.reflection();
reflectionHints.registerTypeIfPresent(classLoader,
"java.sql.Timestamp"
, hint -> hint
.withMethod(
"from"
, List.of(TypeReference.of(Instant
.
class
)),
ExecutableMode
.
INVOKE
)
.
onReachableType
(
TypeReference
.
of
("
java
.
sql
.
Timestamp
")))
;
}
}
Copied!
```
TimestampConversionRuntimeHints
can then be registered declaratively via
@ImportRuntimeHints
or statically via a
META-INF/spring/aot.factories
configuration file.
The above
TimestampConversionRuntimeHints
class is a simplified version of the
ObjectToObjectConverterRuntimeHints
class that is included in the framework and
registered by default.
Thus, this specific
Instant
-to-
Timestamp
use case is already handled by the framework.
Testing Runtime Hints
Spring Core also ships
RuntimeHintsPredicates
, a utility for checking that existing hints match a particular use case.
This can be used in your own tests to validate that a
RuntimeHintsRegistrar
produces the expected results.
We can write a test for our
SpellCheckService
and ensure that we will be able to load a dictionary at runtime:
```
@Test
void
shouldRegisterResourceHints
()
{
RuntimeHints hints =
new
RuntimeHints();
new
SpellCheckServiceRuntimeHints().registerHints(hints, getClass().getClassLoader());
assertThat(RuntimeHintsPredicates.resource().forResource(
"dicts/en.txt"
))
.accepts(hints);
}
Copied!
```
With
RuntimeHintsPredicates
, we can check for reflection, resource, serialization, or proxy generation hints.
This approach works well for unit tests but implies that the runtime behavior of a component is well known.
You can learn more about the global runtime behavior of an application by running its test suite (or the app itself) with the
GraalVM tracing agent
.
This agent will record all relevant calls requiring GraalVM hints at runtime and write them out as JSON configuration files.
For more targeted discovery and testing, Spring Framework ships a dedicated module with core AOT testing utilities,
"org.springframework:spring-core-test"
.
This module contains the RuntimeHints Agent, a Java agent that records all method invocations that are related to runtime hints and helps you to assert that a given
RuntimeHints
instance covers all recorded invocations.
Let’s consider a piece of infrastructure for which we’d like to test the hints we’re contributing during the AOT processing phase.
```
import
java.lang.reflect.Method;
import
org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
import
org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;
import
org.springframework.util.ClassUtils;
public
class
SampleReflection
{
private
final
Log logger = LogFactory.getLog(SampleReflection
.
class
)
;
public
void
performReflection
()
{
try
{
Class<?> springVersion = ClassUtils.forName(
"org.springframework.core.SpringVersion"
,
null
);
Method getVersion = ClassUtils.getMethod(springVersion,
"getVersion"
);
String version = (String) getVersion.invoke(
null
);
logger.info(
"Spring version: "
+ version);
}
catch
(Exception exc) {
logger.error(
"reflection failed"
, exc);
}
}
}
Copied!
```
We can then write a unit test (no native compilation required) that checks our contributed hints:
```
import
java.util.List;
import
org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import
org.springframework.aot.hint.ExecutableMode;
import
org.springframework.aot.hint.RuntimeHints;
import
org.springframework.aot.test.agent.EnabledIfRuntimeHintsAgent;
import
org.springframework.aot.test.agent.RuntimeHintsInvocations;
import
org.springframework.aot.test.agent.RuntimeHintsRecorder;
import
org.springframework.core.SpringVersion;
import
static
org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;
// @EnabledIfRuntimeHintsAgent signals that the annotated test class or test
// method is only enabled if the RuntimeHintsAgent is loaded on the current JVM.
// It also tags tests with the "RuntimeHints" JUnit tag.
@EnabledIfRuntimeHintsAgent
class
SampleReflectionRuntimeHintsTests
{
@Test
void
shouldRegisterReflectionHints
()
{
RuntimeHints runtimeHints =
new
RuntimeHints();
// Call a RuntimeHintsRegistrar that contributes hints like:
runtimeHints.reflection().registerType(SpringVersion
.
class
,
typeHint
->
typeHint
.
withMethod
("
getVersion
",
List
.
of
(),
ExecutableMode
.
INVOKE
))
;
// Invoke the relevant piece of code we want to test within a recording lambda
RuntimeHintsInvocations invocations = RuntimeHintsRecorder.record(() -> {
SampleReflection sample =
new
SampleReflection();
sample.performReflection();
});
// assert that the recorded invocations are covered by the contributed hints
assertThat(invocations).match(runtimeHints);
}
}
Copied!
```
If you forgot to contribute a hint, the test will fail and provide some details about the invocation:
```
org.springframework.docs.core.aot.hints.testing.SampleReflection performReflection
INFO: Spring version: 6.2.0
Missing <"ReflectionHints"> for invocation <java.lang.Class#forName>

There are various ways to configure this Java agent in your build, so please refer to the documentation of your build tool and test execution plugin.
The agent itself can be configured to instrument specific packages (by default, only
org.springframework
is instrumented).
