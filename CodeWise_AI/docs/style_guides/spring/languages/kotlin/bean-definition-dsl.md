Bean Definition DSL
Spring Framework supports registering beans in a functional way by using lambdas
as an alternative to XML or Java configuration (
@Configuration
and
@Bean
). In a nutshell,
it lets you register beans with a lambda that acts as a
FactoryBean
.
This mechanism is very efficient, as it does not require any reflection or CGLIB proxies.
In Java, you can, for example, write the following:
```
class
Foo
{}
class
Bar
{
private
final
Foo foo;
public
Bar
(Foo foo)
{
this
.foo = foo;
}
}
GenericApplicationContext context =
new
GenericApplicationContext();
context.registerBean(Foo
.
class
)
;
context.registerBean(Bar
.
class
, () ->
new
Bar
(
context
.
getBean
(
Foo
.
class
)))
;
Copied!
```
In Kotlin, with reified type parameters and
GenericApplicationContext
Kotlin extensions,
you can instead write the following:
```
class
Foo
class
Bar
(
private
val
foo: Foo)
val
context = GenericApplicationContext().apply {
registerBean<Foo>()
registerBean { Bar(it.getBean()) }
}
Copied!
```
When the class
Bar
has a single constructor, you can even just specify the bean class,
the constructor parameters will be autowired by type:
```
val
context = GenericApplicationContext().apply {
registerBean<Foo>()
registerBean<Bar>()
}
Copied!
```
In order to allow a more declarative approach and cleaner syntax, Spring Framework provides
a
Kotlin bean definition DSL
It declares an
ApplicationContextInitializer
through a clean declarative API,
which lets you deal with profiles and
Environment
for customizing
how beans are registered.
In the following example notice that:
Type inference usually allows to avoid specifying the type for bean references like
ref("bazBean")
It is possible to use Kotlin top level functions to declare beans using callable references like
bean(::myRouter)
in this example
When specifying
bean<Bar>()
or
bean(::myRouter)
, parameters are autowired by type
The
FooBar
bean will be registered only if the
foobar
profile is active
```
class
Foo
class
Bar
(
private
val
foo: Foo)
class
Baz
(
var
message: String =
""
)
class
FooBar
(
private
val
baz: Baz)
val
myBeans = beans {
bean<Foo>()
bean<Bar>()
bean(
"bazBean"
) {
Baz().apply {
message =
"Hello world"
}
}
profile(
"foobar"
) {
bean { FooBar(ref(
"bazBean"
)) }
}
bean(::myRouter)
}
fun
myRouter
(foo:
Foo
, bar:
Bar
, baz:
Baz
)
= router {
// ...
}
Copied!
```
This DSL is programmatic, meaning it allows custom registration logic of beans
through an
if
expression, a
for
loop, or any other Kotlin constructs.
You can then use this
beans()
function to register beans on the application context,
as the following example shows:
```
val
context = GenericApplicationContext().apply {
myBeans.initialize(
this
)
refresh()
}
Copied!
```
Spring Boot is based on JavaConfig and
does not yet provide specific support for functional bean definition
,
but you can experimentally use functional bean definitions through Spring Boot’s
ApplicationContextInitializer
support.
