Extensions
Kotlin
extensions
provide the ability
to extend existing classes with additional functionality. The Spring Framework Kotlin APIs
use these extensions to add new Kotlin-specific conveniences to existing Spring APIs.
The
Spring Framework KDoc API
lists
and documents all available Kotlin extensions and DSLs.
Keep in mind that Kotlin extensions need to be imported to be used. This means,
for example, that the
GenericApplicationContext.registerBean
Kotlin extension
is available only if
org.springframework.context.support.registerBean
is imported.
That said, similar to static imports, an IDE should automatically suggest the import in most cases.
For example,
Kotlin reified type parameters
provide a workaround for JVM
generics type erasure
,
and the Spring Framework provides some extensions to take advantage of this feature.
This allows for a better Kotlin API
RestTemplate
, for the new
WebClient
from Spring
WebFlux, and for various other APIs.
Other libraries, such as Reactor and Spring Data, also provide Kotlin extensions
for their APIs, thus giving a better Kotlin development experience overall.
To retrieve a list of
User
objects in Java, you would normally write the following:
```
Flux<User> users  = client.get().retrieve().bodyToFlux(User
.
class
)
Copied!
```
With Kotlin and the Spring Framework extensions, you can instead write the following:
```
val
users = client.
get
().retrieve().bodyToFlux<User>()
// or (both are equivalent)
val
users : Flux<User> = client.
get
().retrieve().bodyToFlux()
Copied!
```
As in Java,
users
in Kotlin is strongly typed, but Kotlin’s clever type inference allows
for shorter syntax.
