Kotlin
Kotlin
is a statically typed language that targets the JVM
(and other platforms) which allows writing concise and elegant code while providing
very good
interoperability
with existing libraries written in Java.
The Spring Framework provides first-class support for Kotlin and lets developers write
Kotlin applications almost as if the Spring Framework was a native Kotlin framework.
Most of the code samples of the reference documentation are
provided in Kotlin in addition to Java.
The easiest way to build a Spring application with Kotlin is to leverage Spring Boot and
its
dedicated Kotlin support
.
This comprehensive tutorial
will teach you how to build Spring Boot applications with Kotlin using
start.spring.io
.
Feel free to join the #spring channel of
Kotlin Slack
or ask a question with
spring
and
kotlin
as tags on
Stackoverflow
if you need support.
