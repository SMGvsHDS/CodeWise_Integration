Appendix
This part of the reference documentation covers topics that apply to multiple modules
within the core Spring Framework.
Spring Properties
SpringProperties
is a static holder
for properties that control certain low-level aspects of the Spring Framework. Users can
configure these properties via JVM system properties or programmatically via the
SpringProperties.setProperty(String key, String value)
method. The latter may be
necessary if the deployment environment disallows custom JVM system properties. As an
alternative, these properties may be configured in a
spring.properties
file in the root
of the classpath — for example, deployed within the application’s JAR file.
The following table lists all currently supported Spring properties.
Table 1. Supported Spring Properties
Name
Description
spring.aop.ajc.ignore
Instructs Spring to ignore ajc-compiled aspects for Spring AOP proxying, restoring traditional
Spring behavior for scenarios where both weaving and AspectJ auto-proxying are enabled. See
AbstractAspectJAdvisorFactory
for details.
spring.aot.enabled
Indicates the application should run with AOT generated artifacts. See
Ahead of Time Optimizations
and
AotDetector
for details.
spring.beaninfo.ignore
Instructs Spring to use the
Introspector.IGNORE_ALL_BEANINFO
mode when calling the
JavaBeans
Introspector
. See
StandardBeanInfoFactory
for details.
spring.cache.reactivestreams.ignore
Instructs Spring’s caching infrastructure to ignore the presence of Reactive Streams,
in particular Reactor’s
Mono
/
Flux
in
@Cacheable
method return type declarations. See
CacheAspectSupport
for details.
spring.classformat.ignore
Instructs Spring to ignore class format exceptions during classpath scanning, in
particular for unsupported class file versions. See
ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider
for details.
spring.context.checkpoint
Property that specifies a common context checkpoint. See
Automatic checkpoint/restore at startup
and
DefaultLifecycleProcessor
for details.
spring.context.exit
Property for terminating the JVM when the context reaches a specific phase. See
Automatic checkpoint/restore at startup
and
DefaultLifecycleProcessor
for details.
spring.context.expression.maxLength
The maximum length for
Spring Expression Language
expressions used in XML bean definitions,
@Value
, etc.
spring.expression.compiler.mode
The mode to use when compiling expressions for the
Spring Expression Language
.
spring.getenv.ignore
Instructs Spring to ignore operating system environment variables if a Spring
Environment
property — for example, a placeholder in a configuration String — isn’t
resolvable otherwise. See
AbstractEnvironment
for details.
spring.jdbc.getParameterType.ignore
Instructs Spring to ignore
java.sql.ParameterMetaData.getParameterType
completely.
See the note in
Batch Operations with a List of Objects
.
spring.jndi.ignore
Instructs Spring to ignore a default JNDI environment, as an optimization for scenarios
where nothing is ever to be found for such JNDI fallback searches to begin with, avoiding
the repeated JNDI lookup overhead. See
JndiLocatorDelegate
for details.
spring.locking.strict
Instructs Spring to enforce strict locking during bean creation, rather than the mix of
strict and lenient locking that 6.2 applies by default. See
DefaultListableBeanFactory
for details.
spring.objenesis.ignore
Instructs Spring to ignore Objenesis, not even attempting to use it. See
SpringObjenesis
for details.
spring.placeholder.escapeCharacter.default
The default escape character for property placeholder support. If not set,
'\'
will
be used. Can be set to a custom escape character or an empty string to disable support
for an escape character. The default escape character be explicitly overridden in
PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer
and subclasses of
AbstractPropertyResolver
. See
AbstractPropertyResolver
for details.
spring.test.aot.processing.failOnError
A boolean flag that controls whether errors encountered during AOT processing in the
Spring TestContext Framework
should result in an exception that fails the overall process.
See
Ahead of Time Support for Tests
.
spring.test.constructor.autowire.mode
The default
test constructor autowire mode
to use if
@TestConstructor
is not present
on a test class. See
Changing the default test constructor autowire mode
.
spring.test.context.cache.maxSize
The maximum size of the context cache in the
Spring TestContext Framework
. See
Context Caching
.
spring.test.context.failure.threshold
The failure threshold for errors encountered while attempting to load an
ApplicationContext
in the
Spring TestContext Framework
. See
Context Failure Threshold
.
spring.test.enclosing.configuration
The default
enclosing configuration inheritance mode
to use if
@NestedTestConfiguration
is not present on a test class. See
Changing the default enclosing configuration inheritance mode
.
