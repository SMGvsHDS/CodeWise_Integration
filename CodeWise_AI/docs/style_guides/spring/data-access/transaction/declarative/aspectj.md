Using
@Transactional
with AspectJ
You can also use the Spring Framework’s
@Transactional
support outside of a Spring
container by means of an AspectJ aspect. To do so, first annotate your classes
(and optionally your classes' methods) with the
@Transactional
annotation,
and then link (weave) your application with the
org.springframework.transaction.aspectj.AnnotationTransactionAspect
defined in the
spring-aspects.jar
file. You must also configure the aspect with a transaction
manager. You can use the Spring Framework’s IoC container to take care of
dependency-injecting the aspect. The simplest way to configure the transaction
management aspect is to use the
<tx:annotation-driven/>
element and specify the
mode
attribute to
aspectj
as described in
Using
@Transactional
.
Because we focus here on applications that run outside of a Spring container,
we show you how to do it programmatically.
Prior to continuing, you may want to read
Using
@Transactional
and
AOP
respectively.
The following example shows how to create a transaction manager and configure the
AnnotationTransactionAspect
to use it:
Java
Kotlin
```
// construct an appropriate transaction manager
DataSourceTransactionManager txManager =
new
DataSourceTransactionManager(getDataSource());
// configure the AnnotationTransactionAspect to use it; this must be done before executing any transactional methods
AnnotationTransactionAspect.aspectOf().setTransactionManager(txManager);
Copied!
```
```
// construct an appropriate transaction manager
val
txManager = DataSourceTransactionManager(getDataSource())
// configure the AnnotationTransactionAspect to use it; this must be done before executing any transactional methods
AnnotationTransactionAspect.aspectOf().transactionManager = txManager
Copied!
```
When you use this aspect, you must annotate the implementation class (or the methods
within that class or both), not the interface (if any) that the class implements. AspectJ
follows Java’s rule that annotations on interfaces are not inherited.
The
@Transactional
annotation on a class specifies the default transaction semantics
for the execution of any public method in the class.
The
@Transactional
annotation on a method within the class overrides the default
transaction semantics given by the class annotation (if present). You can annotate any method,
regardless of visibility.
To weave your applications with the
AnnotationTransactionAspect
, you must either build
your application with AspectJ (see the
AspectJ Development
Guide
) or use load-time weaving. See
Load-time weaving with AspectJ in the Spring Framework
for a discussion of load-time weaving with AspectJ.
