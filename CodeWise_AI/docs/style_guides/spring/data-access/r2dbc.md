Data Access with R2DBC
R2DBC
("Reactive Relational Database Connectivity") is a community-driven
specification effort to standardize access to SQL databases using reactive patterns.
Package Hierarchy
The Spring Framework’s R2DBC abstraction framework consists of two different packages:
core
: The
org.springframework.r2dbc.core
package contains the
DatabaseClient
class plus a variety of related classes. See
Using the R2DBC Core Classes to Control Basic R2DBC Processing and Error Handling
.
connection
: The
org.springframework.r2dbc.connection
package contains a utility class
for easy
ConnectionFactory
access and various simple
ConnectionFactory
implementations
that you can use for testing and running unmodified R2DBC. See
Controlling Database Connections
.
Using the R2DBC Core Classes to Control Basic R2DBC Processing and Error Handling
This section covers how to use the R2DBC core classes to control basic R2DBC processing,
including error handling. It includes the following topics:
Using
DatabaseClient
Executing Statements
Querying (
SELECT
)
Updating (
INSERT
,
UPDATE
, and
DELETE
) with
DatabaseClient
Statement Filters
Retrieving Auto-generated Keys
Using
DatabaseClient
DatabaseClient
is the central class in the R2DBC core package. It handles the
creation and release of resources, which helps to avoid common errors, such as
forgetting to close the connection. It performs the basic tasks of the core R2DBC
workflow (such as statement creation and execution), leaving application code to provide
SQL and extract results. The
DatabaseClient
class:
Runs SQL queries
Update statements and stored procedure calls
Performs iteration over
Result
instances
Catches R2DBC exceptions and translates them to the generic, more informative,
exception hierarchy defined in the
org.springframework.dao
package.
(See
Consistent Exception Hierarchy
.)
The client has a functional, fluent API using reactive types for declarative composition.
When you use the
DatabaseClient
for your code, you need only to implement
java.util.function
interfaces, giving them a clearly defined contract.
Given a
Connection
provided by the
DatabaseClient
class, a
Function
callback creates a
Publisher
. The same is true for mapping functions that
extract a
Row
result.
You can use
DatabaseClient
within a DAO implementation through direct instantiation
with a
ConnectionFactory
reference, or you can configure it in a Spring IoC container
and give it to DAOs as a bean reference.
The simplest way to create a
DatabaseClient
object is through a static factory method, as follows:
Java
Kotlin
```
DatabaseClient client = DatabaseClient.create(connectionFactory);
Copied!
```
```
val
client = DatabaseClient.create(connectionFactory)
Copied!
```
The
ConnectionFactory
should always be configured as a bean in the Spring IoC
container.
The preceding method creates a
DatabaseClient
with default settings.
You can also obtain a
Builder
instance from
DatabaseClient.builder()
.
You can customize the client by calling the following methods:
….bindMarkers(…)
: Supply a specific
BindMarkersFactory
to configure named
parameter to database bind marker translation.
….executeFunction(…)
: Set the
ExecuteFunction
how
Statement
objects get
run.
….namedParameters(false)
: Disable named parameter expansion. Enabled by default.
Dialects are resolved by
BindMarkersFactoryResolver
from a
ConnectionFactory
, typically by inspecting
ConnectionFactoryMetadata
.
You can let Spring auto-discover your
BindMarkersFactory
by registering a
class that implements
org.springframework.r2dbc.core.binding.BindMarkersFactoryResolver$BindMarkerFactoryProvider
through
META-INF/spring.factories
.
BindMarkersFactoryResolver
discovers bind marker provider implementations from
the class path using Spring’s
SpringFactoriesLoader
.
Currently supported databases are:
H2
MariaDB
Microsoft SQL Server
MySQL
Postgres
All SQL issued by this class is logged at the
DEBUG
level under the category
corresponding to the fully qualified class name of the client instance (typically
DefaultDatabaseClient
). Additionally, each execution registers a checkpoint in
the reactive sequence to aid debugging.
The following sections provide some examples of
DatabaseClient
usage. These examples
are not an exhaustive list of all of the functionality exposed by the
DatabaseClient
.
See the attendant
javadoc
for that.
Executing Statements
DatabaseClient
provides the basic functionality of running a statement.
The following example shows what you need to include for minimal but fully functional
code that creates a new table:
Java
Kotlin
```
Mono<Void> completion = client.sql(
"CREATE TABLE person (id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), age INTEGER);"
)
.then();
Copied!
```
```
client.sql(
"CREATE TABLE person (id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), age INTEGER);"
)
.await()
Copied!
```
DatabaseClient
is designed for convenient, fluent usage.
It exposes intermediate, continuation, and terminal methods at each stage of the
execution specification. The preceding example above uses
then()
to return a completion
Publisher
that completes as soon as the query (or queries, if the SQL query contains
multiple statements) completes.
execute(…)
accepts either the SQL query string or a query
Supplier<String>
to defer the actual query creation until execution.
Querying (
SELECT
)
SQL queries can return values through
Row
objects or the number of affected rows.
DatabaseClient
can return the number of updated rows or the rows themselves,
depending on the issued query.
The following query gets the
id
and
name
columns from a table:
Java
Kotlin
```
Mono<Map<String, Object>> first = client.sql(
"SELECT id, name FROM person"
)
.fetch().first();
Copied!
```
```
val
first = client.sql(
"SELECT id, name FROM person"
)
.fetch().awaitSingle()
Copied!
```
The following query uses a bind variable:
Java
Kotlin
```
Mono<Map<String, Object>> first = client.sql(
"SELECT id, name FROM person WHERE first_name = :fn"
)
.bind(
"fn"
,
"Joe"
)
.fetch().first();
Copied!
```
```
val
first = client.sql(
"SELECT id, name FROM person WHERE first_name = :fn"
)
.bind(
"fn"
,
"Joe"
)
.fetch().awaitSingle()
Copied!
```
You might have noticed the use of
fetch()
in the example above.
fetch()
is a
continuation operator that lets you specify how much data you want to consume.
Calling
first()
returns the first row from the result and discards remaining rows.
You can consume data with the following operators:
first()
return the first row of the entire result. Its Kotlin Coroutine variant
is named
awaitSingle()
for non-nullable return values and
awaitSingleOrNull()
if the value is optional.
one()
returns exactly one result and fails if the result contains more rows.
Using Kotlin Coroutines,
awaitOne()
for exactly one value or
awaitOneOrNull()
if the value may be
null
.
all()
returns all rows of the result. When using Kotlin Coroutines, use
flow()
.
rowsUpdated()
returns the number of affected rows (
INSERT
/
UPDATE
/
DELETE
count). Its Kotlin Coroutine variant is named
awaitRowsUpdated()
.
Without specifying further mapping details, queries return tabular results
as
Map
whose keys are case-insensitive column names that map to their column value.
You can take control over result mapping by supplying a
Function<Row, T>
that gets
called for each
Row
so it can return arbitrary values (singular values,
collections and maps, and objects).
The following example extracts the
name
column and emits its value:
Java
Kotlin
```
Flux<String> names = client.sql(
"SELECT name FROM person"
)
.map(row -> row.get(
"name"
, String
.
class
))
.
all
()
;
Copied!
```
```
val
names = client.sql(
"SELECT name FROM person"
)
.map{ row: Row -> row.
get
(
"name"
, String
.
class
) }
.flow()
Copied!
```
Alternatively, there is a shortcut for mapping to a single value:
```
Flux<String> names = client.sql(
"SELECT name FROM person"
)
.mapValue(String
.
class
)
.
all
()
;
Copied!
```
Or you may map to a result object with bean properties or record components:
```
// assuming a name property on Person
Flux<Person> persons = client.sql(
"SELECT name FROM person"
)
.mapProperties(Person
.
class
)
.
all
()
;
Copied!
```
What about
null
?
Relational database results can contain
null
values.
The Reactive Streams specification forbids the emission of
null
values.
That requirement mandates proper
null
handling in the extractor function.
While you can obtain
null
values from a
Row
, you must not emit a
null
value. You must wrap any
null
values in an object (for example,
Optional
for singular values) to make sure a
null
value is never returned directly
by your extractor function.
Updating (
INSERT
,
UPDATE
, and
DELETE
) with
DatabaseClient
The only difference of modifying statements is that these statements typically
do not return tabular data so you use
rowsUpdated()
to consume results.
The following example shows an
UPDATE
statement that returns the number
of updated rows:
Java
Kotlin
```
Mono<Integer> affectedRows = client.sql(
"UPDATE person SET first_name = :fn"
)
.bind(
"fn"
,
"Joe"
)
.fetch().rowsUpdated();
Copied!
```
```
val
affectedRows = client.sql(
"UPDATE person SET first_name = :fn"
)
.bind(
"fn"
,
"Joe"
)
.fetch().awaitRowsUpdated()
Copied!
```
Binding Values to Queries
A typical application requires parameterized SQL statements to select or
update rows according to some input. These are typically
SELECT
statements
constrained by a
WHERE
clause or
INSERT
and
UPDATE
statements that accept
input parameters. Parameterized statements bear the risk of SQL injection if
parameters are not escaped properly.
DatabaseClient
leverages R2DBC’s
bind
API to eliminate the risk of SQL injection for query parameters.
You can provide a parameterized SQL statement with the
execute(…)
operator
and bind parameters to the actual
Statement
. Your R2DBC driver then runs
the statement by using prepared statements and parameter substitution.
Parameter binding supports two binding strategies:
By Index, using zero-based parameter indexes.
By Name, using the placeholder name.
The following example shows parameter binding for a query:
```
db.sql(
"INSERT INTO person (id, name, age) VALUES(:id, :name, :age)"
)
.bind(
"id"
,
"joe"
)
.bind(
"name"
,
"Joe"
)
.bind(
"age"
,
34
);
Copied!
```
Alternatively, you may pass in a map of names and values:
```
Map<String, Object> params =
new
LinkedHashMap<>();
params.put(
"id"
,
"joe"
);
params.put(
"name"
,
"Joe"
);
params.put(
"age"
,
34
);
db.sql(
"INSERT INTO person (id, name, age) VALUES(:id, :name, :age)"
)
.bindValues(params);
Copied!
```
Or you may pass in a parameter object with bean properties or record components:
```
// assuming id, name, age properties on Person
db.sql(
"INSERT INTO person (id, name, age) VALUES(:id, :name, :age)"
)
.bindProperties(
new
Person(
"joe"
,
"Joe"
,
34
);
Copied!
```
Alternatively, you can use positional parameters for binding values to statements.
Indices are zero based.
```
db.sql(
"INSERT INTO person (id, name, age) VALUES(:id, :name, :age)"
)
.bind(
0
,
"joe"
)
.bind(
1
,
"Joe"
)
.bind(
2
,
34
);
Copied!
```
In case your application is binding to many parameters, the same can be achieved with a single call:
```
List<?> values = List.of(
"joe"
,
"Joe"
,
34
);
db.sql(
"INSERT INTO person (id, name, age) VALUES(:id, :name, :age)"
)
.bindValues(values);
Copied!
```
R2DBC Native Bind Markers
R2DBC uses database-native bind markers that depend on the actual database vendor.
As an example, Postgres uses indexed markers, such as
$1
,
$2
,
$n
.
Another example is SQL Server, which uses named bind markers prefixed with
@
.
This is different from JDBC which requires
?
as bind markers.
In JDBC, the actual drivers translate
?
bind markers to database-native
markers as part of their statement execution.
Spring Framework’s R2DBC support lets you use native bind markers or named bind
markers with the
:name
syntax.
Named parameter support leverages a
BindMarkersFactory
instance to expand named
parameters to native bind markers at the time of query execution, which gives you
a certain degree of query portability across various database vendors.
The query-preprocessor unrolls named
Collection
parameters into a series of bind
markers to remove the need of dynamic query creation based on the number of arguments.
Nested object arrays are expanded to allow usage of (for example) select lists.
Consider the following query:
```
SELECT
id
,
name
, state
FROM
table
WHERE
(
name
, age)
IN
((
'John'
,
35
), (
'Ann'
,
50
))
Copied!
```
The preceding query can be parameterized and run as follows:
Java
Kotlin
```
List<Object[]> tuples =
new
ArrayList<>();
tuples.add(
new
Object[] {
"John"
,
35
});
tuples.add(
new
Object[] {
"Ann"
,
50
});
client.sql(
"SELECT id, name, state FROM table WHERE (name, age) IN (:tuples)"
)
.bind(
"tuples"
, tuples);
Copied!
```
```
val
tuples: MutableList<Array<Any>> = ArrayList()
tuples.add(arrayOf(
"John"
,
35
))
tuples.add(arrayOf(
"Ann"
,
50
))
client.sql(
"SELECT id, name, state FROM table WHERE (name, age) IN (:tuples)"
)
.bind(
"tuples"
, tuples)
Copied!
```
Usage of select lists is vendor-dependent.
The following example shows a simpler variant using
IN
predicates:
Java
Kotlin
```
client.sql(
"SELECT id, name, state FROM table WHERE age IN (:ages)"
)
.bind(
"ages"
, Arrays.asList(
35
,
50
));
Copied!
```
```
client.sql(
"SELECT id, name, state FROM table WHERE age IN (:ages)"
)
.bind(
"ages"
, arrayOf(
35
,
50
))
Copied!
```
R2DBC itself does not support Collection-like values. Nevertheless,
expanding a given
List
in the example above works for named parameters
in Spring’s R2DBC support, for example, for use in
IN
clauses as shown above.
However, inserting or updating array-typed columns (for example, in Postgres)
requires an array type that is supported by the underlying R2DBC driver:
typically a Java array, for example,
String[]
to update a
text[]
column.
Do not pass
Collection<String>
or the like as an array parameter.
Statement Filters
Sometimes you need to fine-tune options on the actual
Statement
before it gets run. To do so, register a
Statement
filter
(
StatementFilterFunction
) with the
DatabaseClient
to intercept and
modify statements in their execution, as the following example shows:
Java
Kotlin
```
client.sql(
"INSERT INTO table (name, state) VALUES(:name, :state)"
)
.filter((s, next) -> next.execute(s.returnGeneratedValues(
"id"
)))
.bind(
"name"
, …)
.bind(
"state"
, …);
Copied!
```
```
client.sql(
"INSERT INTO table (name, state) VALUES(:name, :state)"
)
.filter { s: Statement, next: ExecuteFunction -> next.execute(s.returnGeneratedValues(
"id"
)) }
.bind(
"name"
, …)
.bind(
"state"
, …)
Copied!
```
DatabaseClient
also exposes a simplified
filter(…)
overload that accepts
a
Function<Statement, Statement>
:
Java
Kotlin
```
client.sql(
"INSERT INTO table (name, state) VALUES(:name, :state)"
)
.filter(statement -> s.returnGeneratedValues(
"id"
));
client.sql(
"SELECT id, name, state FROM table"
)
.filter(statement -> s.fetchSize(
25
));
Copied!
```
```
client.sql(
"INSERT INTO table (name, state) VALUES(:name, :state)"
)
.filter { statement -> s.returnGeneratedValues(
"id"
) }
client.sql(
"SELECT id, name, state FROM table"
)
.filter { statement -> s.fetchSize(
25
) }
Copied!
```
StatementFilterFunction
implementations allow filtering of the
Statement
and filtering of
Result
objects.
DatabaseClient
Best Practices
Instances of the
DatabaseClient
class are thread-safe, once configured. This is
important because it means that you can configure a single instance of a
DatabaseClient
and then safely inject this shared reference into multiple DAOs (or repositories).
The
DatabaseClient
is stateful, in that it maintains a reference to a
ConnectionFactory
,
but this state is not conversational state.
A common practice when using the
DatabaseClient
class is to configure a
ConnectionFactory
in your Spring configuration file and then dependency-inject
that shared
ConnectionFactory
bean into your DAO classes. The
DatabaseClient
is created in
the setter for the
ConnectionFactory
. This leads to DAOs that resemble the following:
Java
Kotlin
```
public
class
R2dbcCorporateEventDao
implements
CorporateEventDao
{
private
DatabaseClient databaseClient;
public
void
setConnectionFactory
(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory)
{
this
.databaseClient = DatabaseClient.create(connectionFactory);
}
// R2DBC-backed implementations of the methods on the CorporateEventDao follow...
}
Copied!
```
```
class
R2dbcCorporateEventDao
(connectionFactory: ConnectionFactory) : CorporateEventDao {
private
val
databaseClient = DatabaseClient.create(connectionFactory)
// R2DBC-backed implementations of the methods on the CorporateEventDao follow...
}
Copied!
```
An alternative to explicit configuration is to use component-scanning and annotation
support for dependency injection. In this case, you can annotate the class with
@Component
(which makes it a candidate for component-scanning) and annotate the
ConnectionFactory
setter
method with
@Autowired
. The following example shows how to do so:
Java
Kotlin
```
@Component
(
1
)
public
class
R2dbcCorporateEventDao
implements
CorporateEventDao
{
private
DatabaseClient databaseClient;
@Autowired
(
2
)
public
void
setConnectionFactory
(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory)
{
this
.databaseClient = DatabaseClient.create(connectionFactory);
(
3
)
}
// R2DBC-backed implementations of the methods on the CorporateEventDao follow...
}
Copied!
```
1
Annotate the class with
@Component
.
2
Annotate the
ConnectionFactory
setter method with
@Autowired
.
3
Create a new
DatabaseClient
with the
ConnectionFactory
.
```
@Component
(
1
)
class
R2dbcCorporateEventDao
(connectionFactory: ConnectionFactory) : CorporateEventDao {
(
2
)
private
val
databaseClient = DatabaseClient(connectionFactory)
(
3
)
// R2DBC-backed implementations of the methods on the CorporateEventDao follow...
}
Copied!
```
1
Annotate the class with
@Component
.
2
Constructor injection of the
ConnectionFactory
.
3
Create a new
DatabaseClient
with the
ConnectionFactory
.
Regardless of which of the above template initialization styles you choose to use (or
not), it is seldom necessary to create a new instance of a
DatabaseClient
class each
time you want to run SQL. Once configured, a
DatabaseClient
instance is thread-safe.
If your application accesses multiple
databases, you may want multiple
DatabaseClient
instances, which requires multiple
ConnectionFactory
and, subsequently, multiple differently configured
DatabaseClient
instances.
Retrieving Auto-generated Keys
INSERT
statements may generate keys when inserting rows into a table
that defines an auto-increment or identity column. To get full control over
the column name to generate, simply register a
StatementFilterFunction
that
requests the generated key for the desired column.
Java
Kotlin
```
Mono<Integer> generatedId = client.sql(
"INSERT INTO table (name, state) VALUES(:name, :state)"
)
.filter(statement -> s.returnGeneratedValues(
"id"
))
.map(row -> row.get(
"id"
, Integer
.
class
))
.
first
()
;
// generatedId emits the generated key once the INSERT statement has finished
Copied!
```
```
val
generatedId = client.sql(
"INSERT INTO table (name, state) VALUES(:name, :state)"
)
.filter { statement -> s.returnGeneratedValues(
"id"
) }
.map { row -> row.
get
(
"id"
, Integer
.
class
) }
.awaitOne()
// generatedId emits the generated key once the INSERT statement has finished
Copied!
```
Controlling Database Connections
This section covers:
Using
ConnectionFactory
Using
ConnectionFactoryUtils
Using
SingleConnectionFactory
Using
TransactionAwareConnectionFactoryProxy
Using
R2dbcTransactionManager
Using
ConnectionFactory
Spring obtains an R2DBC connection to the database through a
ConnectionFactory
.
A
ConnectionFactory
is part of the R2DBC specification and is a common entry-point
for drivers. It lets a container or a framework hide connection pooling
and transaction management issues from the application code. As a developer,
you need not know details about how to connect to the database. That is the
responsibility of the administrator who sets up the
ConnectionFactory
. You
most likely fill both roles as you develop and test code, but you do not
necessarily have to know how the production data source is configured.
When you use Spring’s R2DBC layer, you can configure your own with a
connection pool implementation provided by a third party. A popular
implementation is R2DBC Pool (
r2dbc-pool
). Implementations in the Spring
distribution are meant only for testing purposes and do not provide pooling.
To configure a
ConnectionFactory
:
Obtain a connection with
ConnectionFactory
as you typically obtain an R2DBC
ConnectionFactory
.
Provide an R2DBC URL
(See the documentation for your driver for the correct value).
The following example shows how to configure a
ConnectionFactory
:
Java
Kotlin
```
ConnectionFactory factory = ConnectionFactories.get(
"r2dbc:h2:mem:///test?options=DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE"
);
Copied!
```
```
val
factory = ConnectionFactories.
get
(
"r2dbc:h2:mem:///test?options=DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE"
);
Copied!
```
Using
ConnectionFactoryUtils
The
ConnectionFactoryUtils
class is a convenient and powerful helper class
that provides
static
methods to obtain connections from
ConnectionFactory
and close connections (if necessary).
It supports subscriber
Context
-bound connections with, for example
R2dbcTransactionManager
.
Using
SingleConnectionFactory
The
SingleConnectionFactory
class is an implementation of
DelegatingConnectionFactory
interface that wraps a single
Connection
that is not closed after each use.
If any client code calls
close
on the assumption of a pooled connection (as when using
persistence tools), you should set the
suppressClose
property to
true
. This setting
returns a close-suppressing proxy that wraps the physical connection. Note that you can
no longer cast this to a native
Connection
or a similar object.
SingleConnectionFactory
is primarily a test class and may be used for specific requirements
such as pipelining if your R2DBC driver permits for such use.
In contrast to a pooled
ConnectionFactory
, it reuses the same connection all the time, avoiding
excessive creation of physical connections.
Using
TransactionAwareConnectionFactoryProxy
TransactionAwareConnectionFactoryProxy
is a proxy for a target
ConnectionFactory
.
The proxy wraps that target
ConnectionFactory
to add awareness of Spring-managed transactions.
Using this class is required if you use a R2DBC client that is not integrated otherwise
with Spring’s R2DBC support. In this case, you can still use this client and, at
the same time, have this client participating in Spring managed transactions. It is generally
preferable to integrate a R2DBC client with proper access to
ConnectionFactoryUtils
for resource management.
See the
TransactionAwareConnectionFactoryProxy
javadoc for more details.
Using
R2dbcTransactionManager
The
R2dbcTransactionManager
class is a
ReactiveTransactionManager
implementation for
a single R2DBC
ConnectionFactory
. It binds an R2DBC
Connection
from the specified
ConnectionFactory
to the subscriber
Context
, potentially allowing for one subscriber
Connection
for each
ConnectionFactory
.
Application code is required to retrieve the R2DBC
Connection
through
ConnectionFactoryUtils.getConnection(ConnectionFactory)
, instead of R2DBC’s standard
ConnectionFactory.create()
. All framework classes (such as
DatabaseClient
) use this
strategy implicitly. If not used with a transaction manager, the lookup strategy behaves
exactly like
ConnectionFactory.create()
and can therefore be used in any case.
