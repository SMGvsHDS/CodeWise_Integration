View Technologies
See equivalent in the Servlet stack
The rendering of views in Spring WebFlux is pluggable. Whether you decide to
use Thymeleaf, FreeMarker, or some other view technology is primarily a matter of a
configuration change. This chapter covers the view technologies integrated with Spring
WebFlux.
For more context on view rendering, please see
View Resolution
.
The views of a Spring WebFlux application live within internal trust boundaries
of the application. Views have access to beans in the application context, and as
such, we do not recommend use the Spring WebFlux template support in applications where
the templates are editable by external sources, since this can have security implications.
Thymeleaf
See equivalent in the Servlet stack
Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine that emphasizes natural HTML
templates that can be previewed in a browser by double-clicking, which is very
helpful for independent work on UI templates (for example, by a designer) without the need for a
running server. Thymeleaf offers an extensive set of features, and it is actively developed
and maintained. For a more complete introduction, see the
Thymeleaf
project home page.
The Thymeleaf integration with Spring WebFlux is managed by the Thymeleaf project. The
configuration involves a few bean declarations, such as
SpringResourceTemplateResolver
,
SpringWebFluxTemplateEngine
, and
ThymeleafReactiveViewResolver
. For more details, see
Thymeleaf+Spring
and the WebFlux integration
announcement
.
FreeMarker
See equivalent in the Servlet stack
Apache FreeMarker
is a template engine for generating any
kind of text output from HTML to email and others. The Spring Framework has built-in
integration for using Spring WebFlux with FreeMarker templates.
View Configuration
See equivalent in the Servlet stack
The following example shows how to configure FreeMarker as a view technology:
Java
Kotlin
```
@Configuration
@EnableWebFlux
public
class
WebConfig
implements
WebFluxConfigurer
{
@Override
public
void
configureViewResolvers
(ViewResolverRegistry registry)
{
registry.freeMarker();
}
// Configure FreeMarker...
@Bean
public
FreeMarkerConfigurer
freeMarkerConfigurer
()
{
FreeMarkerConfigurer configurer =
new
FreeMarkerConfigurer();
configurer.setTemplateLoaderPath(
"classpath:/templates/freemarker"
);
return
configurer;
}
}
Copied!
```
```
@Configuration
@EnableWebFlux
class
WebConfig
:
WebFluxConfigurer {
override
fun
configureViewResolvers
(registry:
ViewResolverRegistry
)
{
registry.freeMarker()
}
// Configure FreeMarker...
@Bean
fun
freeMarkerConfigurer
()
= FreeMarkerConfigurer().apply {
setTemplateLoaderPath(
"classpath:/templates/freemarker"
)
}
}
Copied!
```
Your templates need to be stored in the directory specified by the
FreeMarkerConfigurer
,
shown in the preceding example. Given the preceding configuration, if your controller
returns the view name,
welcome
, the resolver looks for the
classpath:/templates/freemarker/welcome.ftl
template.
FreeMarker Configuration
See equivalent in the Servlet stack
You can pass FreeMarker 'Settings' and 'SharedVariables' directly to the FreeMarker
Configuration
object (which is managed by Spring) by setting the appropriate bean
properties on the
FreeMarkerConfigurer
bean. The
freemarkerSettings
property requires
a
java.util.Properties
object, and the
freemarkerVariables
property requires a
java.util.Map
. The following example shows how to use a
FreeMarkerConfigurer
:
Java
Kotlin
```
@Configuration
@EnableWebFlux
public
class
WebConfig
implements
WebFluxConfigurer
{
// ...
@Bean
public
FreeMarkerConfigurer
freeMarkerConfigurer
()
{
Map<String, Object> variables =
new
HashMap<>();
variables.put(
"xml_escape"
,
new
XmlEscape());
FreeMarkerConfigurer configurer =
new
FreeMarkerConfigurer();
configurer.setTemplateLoaderPath(
"classpath:/templates"
);
configurer.setFreemarkerVariables(variables);
return
configurer;
}
}
Copied!
```
```
@Configuration
@EnableWebFlux
class
WebConfig
:
WebFluxConfigurer {
// ...
@Bean
fun
freeMarkerConfigurer
()
= FreeMarkerConfigurer().apply {
setTemplateLoaderPath(
"classpath:/templates"
)
setFreemarkerVariables(mapOf(
"xml_escape"
to XmlEscape()))
}
}
Copied!
```
See the FreeMarker documentation for details of settings and variables as they apply to
the
Configuration
object.
Form Handling
See equivalent in the Servlet stack
Spring provides a tag library for use in JSPs that contains, among others, a
<spring:bind/>
element. This element primarily lets forms display values from
form-backing objects and show the results of failed validations from a
Validator
in the
web or business tier. Spring also has support for the same functionality in FreeMarker,
with additional convenience macros for generating form input elements themselves.
The Bind Macros
See equivalent in the Servlet stack
A standard set of macros are maintained within the
spring-webflux.jar
file for
FreeMarker, so they are always available to a suitably configured application.
Some of the macros defined in the Spring templating libraries are considered internal
(private), but no such scoping exists in the macro definitions, making all macros visible
to calling code and user templates. The following sections concentrate only on the macros
you need to directly call from within your templates. If you wish to view the macro code
directly, the file is called
spring.ftl
and is in the
org.springframework.web.reactive.result.view.freemarker
package.
For additional details on binding support, see
Simple Binding
for Spring MVC.
Form Macros
For details on Spring’s form macro support for FreeMarker templates, consult the following
sections of the Spring MVC documentation.
Input Macros
Input Fields
Selection Fields
HTML Escaping
Script Views
See equivalent in the Servlet stack
The Spring Framework has a built-in integration for using Spring WebFlux with any
templating library that can run on top of the
JSR-223
Java scripting engine.
The following table shows the templating libraries that we have tested on different script engines:
Scripting Library
Scripting Engine
Handlebars
Nashorn
Mustache
Nashorn
React
Nashorn
EJS
Nashorn
ERB
JRuby
String templates
Jython
Kotlin Script templating
Kotlin
The basic rule for integrating any other script engine is that it must implement the
ScriptEngine
and
Invocable
interfaces.
Requirements
See equivalent in the Servlet stack
You need to have the script engine on your classpath, the details of which vary by script engine:
The
Nashorn
JavaScript engine is provided with
Java 8+. Using the latest update release available is highly recommended.
JRuby
should be added as a dependency for Ruby support.
Jython
should be added as a dependency for Python support.
org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-script-util
dependency and a
META-INF/services/javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory
file containing a
org.jetbrains.kotlin.script.jsr223.KotlinJsr223JvmLocalScriptEngineFactory
line should be added for Kotlin script support. See
this example
for more detail.
You need to have the script templating library. One way to do that for JavaScript is
through
WebJars
.
Script Templates
See equivalent in the Servlet stack
You can declare a
ScriptTemplateConfigurer
bean to specify the script engine to use,
the script files to load, what function to call to render templates, and so on.
The following example uses Mustache templates and the Nashorn JavaScript engine:
Java
Kotlin
```
@Configuration
@EnableWebFlux
public
class
WebConfig
implements
WebFluxConfigurer
{
@Override
public
void
configureViewResolvers
(ViewResolverRegistry registry)
{
registry.scriptTemplate();
}
@Bean
public
ScriptTemplateConfigurer
configurer
()
{
ScriptTemplateConfigurer configurer =
new
ScriptTemplateConfigurer();
configurer.setEngineName(
"nashorn"
);
configurer.setScripts(
"mustache.js"
);
configurer.setRenderObject(
"Mustache"
);
configurer.setRenderFunction(
"render"
);
return
configurer;
}
}
Copied!
```
```
@Configuration
@EnableWebFlux
class
WebConfig
:
WebFluxConfigurer {
override
fun
configureViewResolvers
(registry:
ViewResolverRegistry
)
{
registry.scriptTemplate()
}
@Bean
fun
configurer
()
= ScriptTemplateConfigurer().apply {
engineName =
"nashorn"
setScripts(
"mustache.js"
)
renderObject =
"Mustache"
renderFunction =
"render"
}
}
Copied!
```
The
render
function is called with the following parameters:
String template
: The template content
Map model
: The view model
RenderingContext renderingContext
: The
RenderingContext
that gives access to the application context, the locale, the template loader, and the
URL (since 5.0)
Mustache.render()
is natively compatible with this signature, so you can call it directly.
If your templating technology requires some customization, you can provide a script that
implements a custom render function. For example,
Handlerbars
needs to compile templates before using them and requires a
polyfill
in order to emulate some
browser facilities not available in the server-side script engine.
The following example shows how to set a custom render function:
Java
Kotlin
```
@Configuration
@EnableWebFlux
public
class
WebConfig
implements
WebFluxConfigurer
{
@Override
public
void
configureViewResolvers
(ViewResolverRegistry registry)
{
registry.scriptTemplate();
}
@Bean
public
ScriptTemplateConfigurer
configurer
()
{
ScriptTemplateConfigurer configurer =
new
ScriptTemplateConfigurer();
configurer.setEngineName(
"nashorn"
);
configurer.setScripts(
"polyfill.js"
,
"handlebars.js"
,
"render.js"
);
configurer.setRenderFunction(
"render"
);
configurer.setSharedEngine(
false
);
return
configurer;
}
}
Copied!
```
```
@Configuration
@EnableWebFlux
class
WebConfig
:
WebFluxConfigurer {
override
fun
configureViewResolvers
(registry:
ViewResolverRegistry
)
{
registry.scriptTemplate()
}
@Bean
fun
configurer
()
= ScriptTemplateConfigurer().apply {
engineName =
"nashorn"
setScripts(
"polyfill.js"
,
"handlebars.js"
,
"render.js"
)
renderFunction =
"render"
isSharedEngine =
false
}
}
Copied!
```
Setting the
sharedEngine
property to
false
is required when using non-thread-safe
script engines with templating libraries not designed for concurrency, such as Handlebars or
React running on Nashorn. In that case, Java SE 8 update 60 is required, due to
this bug
, but it is generally
recommended to use a recent Java SE patch release in any case.
polyfill.js
defines only the
window
object needed by Handlebars to run properly,
as the following snippet shows:
```
var
window
= {};
Copied!
```
This basic
render.js
implementation compiles the template before using it. A production
ready implementation should also store and reused cached templates or pre-compiled templates.
This can be done on the script side, as well as any customization you need (managing
template engine configuration for example).
The following example shows how compile a template:
```
function
render
(
template, model
)
{
var
compiledTemplate = Handlebars.compile(template);
return
compiledTemplate(model);
}
Copied!
```
Check out the Spring Framework unit tests,
Java
, and
resources
,
for more configuration examples.
HTML Fragment
See equivalent in the Servlet stack
HTMX
and
Hotwire Turbo
emphasize an
HTML-over-the-wire approach where clients receive server updates in HTML rather than in JSON.
This allows the benefits of an SPA (single page app) without having to write much or even
any JavaScript. For a good overview and to learn more, please visit their respective
websites.
In Spring WebFlux, view rendering typically involves specifying one view and one model.
However, in HTML-over-the-wire a common capability is to send multiple HTML fragments that
the browser can use to update different parts of the page. For this, controller methods
can return
Collection<Fragment>
. For example:
Java
Kotlin
```
@GetMapping
List<Fragment>
handle
()
{
return
List.of(Fragment.create(
"posts"
), Fragment.create(
"comments"
));
}
Copied!
```
```
@GetMapping
fun
handle
()
: List<Fragment> {
return
listOf(Fragment.create(
"posts"
), Fragment.create(
"comments"
))
}
Copied!
```
The same can be done also by returning the dedicated type
FragmentsRendering
:
Java
Kotlin
```
@GetMapping
FragmentsRendering
handle
()
{
return
FragmentsRendering.with(
"posts"
).fragment(
"comments"
).build();
}
Copied!
```
```
@GetMapping
fun
handle
()
: FragmentsRendering {
return
FragmentsRendering.with(
"posts"
).fragment(
"comments"
).build()
}
Copied!
```
Each fragment can have an independent model, and that model inherits attributes from the
shared model for the request.
HTMX and Hotwire Turbo support streaming updates over SSE (server-sent events).
A controller can create
FragmentsRendering
with a
Flux<Fragment>
, or with any other
reactive producer adaptable to a Reactive Streams
Publisher
via
ReactiveAdapterRegistry
.
It is also possible to return
Flux<Fragment>
directly without the
FragmentsRendering
wrapper.
JSON and XML
See equivalent in the Servlet stack
For
Content Negotiation
purposes, it is useful to be able to alternate between rendering a model with an HTML template
or as other formats (such as JSON or XML), depending on the content type requested by the client.
To support doing so, Spring WebFlux provides the
HttpMessageWriterView
, which you can use to
plug in any of the available
Codecs
from
spring-web
, such as
Jackson2JsonEncoder
,
Jackson2SmileEncoder
, or
Jaxb2XmlEncoder
.
Unlike other view technologies,
HttpMessageWriterView
does not require a
ViewResolver
but is
instead
configured
as a default view.
You can configure one or more such default views, wrapping different
HttpMessageWriter
instances
or
Encoder
instances. The one that matches the requested content type is used at runtime.
In most cases, a model contains multiple attributes. To determine which one to serialize,
you can configure
HttpMessageWriterView
with the name of the model attribute to use for
rendering. If the model contains only one attribute, that one is used.
