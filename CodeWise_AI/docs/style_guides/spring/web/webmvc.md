Spring Web MVC
Spring Web MVC is the original web framework built on the Servlet API and has been included
in the Spring Framework from the very beginning. The formal name, "Spring Web MVC,"
comes from the name of its source module
(
spring-webmvc
),
but it is more commonly known as "Spring MVC".
Parallel to Spring Web MVC, Spring Framework 5.0 introduced a reactive-stack web framework
whose name, "Spring WebFlux," is also based on its source module
(
spring-webflux
).
This chapter covers Spring Web MVC. For reactive-stack web applications, see
Web on Reactive Stack
