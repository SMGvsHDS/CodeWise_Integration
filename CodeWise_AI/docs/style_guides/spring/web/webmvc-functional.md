Functional Endpoints
See equivalent in the Reactive stack
Spring Web MVC includes WebMvc.fn, a lightweight functional programming model in which functions
are used to route and handle requests and contracts are designed for immutability.
It is an alternative to the annotation-based programming model but otherwise runs on
the same
DispatcherServlet
.
Overview
See equivalent in the Reactive stack
In WebMvc.fn, an HTTP request is handled with a
HandlerFunction
: a function that takes
ServerRequest
and returns a
ServerResponse
.
Both the request and the response object have immutable contracts that offer JDK 8-friendly
access to the HTTP request and response.
HandlerFunction
is the equivalent of the body of a
@RequestMapping
method in the
annotation-based programming model.
Incoming requests are routed to a handler function with a
RouterFunction
: a function that
takes
ServerRequest
and returns an optional
HandlerFunction
(i.e.
Optional<HandlerFunction>
).
When the router function matches, a handler function is returned; otherwise an empty Optional.
RouterFunction
is the equivalent of a
@RequestMapping
annotation, but with the major
difference that router functions provide not just data, but also behavior.
RouterFunctions.route()
provides a router builder that facilitates the creation of routers,
as the following example shows:
Java
Kotlin
```
import
static
org.springframework.http.MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON;
import
static
org.springframework.web.servlet.function.RequestPredicates.*;
import
static
org.springframework.web.servlet.function.RouterFunctions.route;
PersonRepository repository = ...
PersonHandler handler =
new
PersonHandler(repository);
RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route = route()
(
1
)
.GET(
"/person/{id}"
, accept(APPLICATION_JSON), handler::getPerson)
.GET(
"/person"
, accept(APPLICATION_JSON), handler::listPeople)
.POST(
"/person"
, handler::createPerson)
.build();

class
PersonHandler
{
// ...

Create router using the router DSL.
If you register the
RouterFunction
as a bean, for instance by exposing it in a
@Configuration
class, it will be auto-detected by the servlet, as explained in
Running a Server
.
HandlerFunction
See equivalent in the Reactive stack
ServerRequest
and
ServerResponse
are immutable interfaces that offer JDK 8-friendly
access to the HTTP request and response, including headers, body, method, and status code.
ServerRequest
ServerRequest
provides access to the HTTP method, URI, headers, and query parameters,
while access to the body is provided through the
body
methods.
The following example extracts the request body to a
String
:
Java
Kotlin
```
String string = request.body(String
.
class
)
;
Copied!
```
```
val
string = request.body<String>()
Copied!
```
The following example extracts the body to a
List<Person>
,
where
Person
objects are decoded from a serialized form, such as JSON or XML:
Java
Kotlin
```
List<Person> people = request.body(
new
ParameterizedTypeReference<List<Person>>() {});
Copied!
```
```
val
people = request.body<Person>()
Copied!
```
The following example shows how to access parameters:
Java
Kotlin
```
MultiValueMap<String, String> params = request.params();
Copied!
```
```
val
map = request.params()
Copied!
```
The following shows how to bind request parameters, including an optional
DataBinder
customization:
Java
Kotlin
```
Pet pet = request.bind(Pet
.
class
,
dataBinder
->
dataBinder
.
setAllowedFields
("
name
"))
;
Copied!
```
```
val
pet = request.bind(Pet::
class
.
java
,
{dataBinder -> dataBinder.setAllowedFields
(
"name"
)})
Copied!
```
ServerResponse
ServerResponse
provides access to the HTTP response and, since it is immutable, you can use
a
build
method to create it. You can use the builder to set the response status, to add response
headers, or to provide a body. The following example creates a 200 (OK) response with JSON
content:
Java
Kotlin
```
Person person = ...
ServerResponse.ok().contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON).body(person);
Copied!
```
```
val
person: Person = ...
ServerResponse.ok().contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON).body(person)
Copied!
```
The following example shows how to build a 201 (CREATED) response with a
Location
header and no body:
Java
Kotlin
```
URI location = ...
ServerResponse.created(location).build();
Copied!
```
```
val
location: URI = ...
ServerResponse.created(location).build()
Copied!
```
You can also use an asynchronous result as the body, in the form of a
CompletableFuture
,
Publisher
, or any other type supported by the
ReactiveAdapterRegistry
. For instance:
Java
Kotlin
```
Mono<Person> person = webClient.get().retrieve().bodyToMono(Person
.
class
)
;
ServerResponse.ok().contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON).body(person);
Copied!
```
```
val
person = webClient.
get
().retrieve().awaitBody<Person>()
ServerResponse.ok().contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON).body(person)
Copied!
```
If not just the body, but also the status or headers are based on an asynchronous type,
you can use the static
async
method on
ServerResponse
, which
accepts
CompletableFuture<ServerResponse>
,
Publisher<ServerResponse>
, or
any other asynchronous type supported by the
ReactiveAdapterRegistry
. For instance:
Java
```
Mono<ServerResponse> asyncResponse = webClient.get().retrieve().bodyToMono(Person
.
class
)
.
map
(
p
->
ServerResponse
.
ok
().
header
("
Name
",
p
.
name
()).
body
(
p
))
;
ServerResponse.async(asyncResponse);
Copied!
```
Server-Sent Events
can be provided via the
static
sse
method on
ServerResponse
. The builder provided by that method
allows you to send Strings, or other objects as JSON. For example:
Java
Kotlin
```
public
RouterFunction<ServerResponse>
sse
()
{
return
route(GET(
"/sse"
), request -> ServerResponse.sse(sseBuilder -> {
// Save the sseBuilder object somewhere..
}));
}
// In some other thread, sending a String
sseBuilder.send(
"Hello world"
);
// Or an object, which will be transformed into JSON
Person person = ...
sseBuilder.send(person);
// Customize the event by using the other methods
sseBuilder.id(
"42"
)
.event(
"sse event"
)
.data(person);
// and done at some point
sseBuilder.complete();
Copied!
```
```
fun
sse
()
: RouterFunction<ServerResponse> = router {
GET(
"/sse"
) { request -> ServerResponse.sse { sseBuilder ->
// Save the sseBuilder object somewhere..
}
}
// In some other thread, sending a String
sseBuilder.send(
"Hello world"
)
// Or an object, which will be transformed into JSON
val
person = ...
sseBuilder.send(person)
// Customize the event by using the other methods
sseBuilder.id(
"42"
)
.event(
"sse event"
)
.
data
(person)
// and done at some point
sseBuilder.complete()
Copied!
```
Handler Classes
We can write a handler function as a lambda, as the following example shows:
Java
Kotlin
```
HandlerFunction<ServerResponse> helloWorld =
request -> ServerResponse.ok().body(
"Hello World"
);
Copied!
```
```
val
helloWorld: (ServerRequest) -> ServerResponse =
{ ServerResponse.ok().body(
"Hello World"
) }
Copied!
```
That is convenient, but in an application we need multiple functions, and multiple inline
lambda’s can get messy.
Therefore, it is useful to group related handler functions together into a handler class, which
has a similar role as
@Controller
in an annotation-based application.
For example, the following class exposes a reactive
Person
repository:
Java
Kotlin
```
import
static
org.springframework.http.MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON;
import
static
org.springframework.web.reactive.function.server.ServerResponse.ok;
public
class
PersonHandler
{
private
final
PersonRepository repository;
public
PersonHandler
(PersonRepository repository)
{
this
.repository = repository;
}
public
ServerResponse
listPeople
(ServerRequest request)
{
(
1
)
List<Person> people = repository.allPeople();
return
ok().contentType(APPLICATION_JSON).body(people);
}
public
ServerResponse
createPerson
(ServerRequest request)
throws
Exception
{
(
2
)
Person person = request.body(Person
.
class
)
;
repository.savePerson(person);
return
ok().build();
}
public
ServerResponse
getPerson
(ServerRequest request)
{
(
3
)
int
personId = Integer.parseInt(request.pathVariable(
"id"
));
Person person = repository.getPerson(personId);
if
(person !=
null
) {
return
ok().contentType(APPLICATION_JSON).body(person);
}
else
{
return
ServerResponse.notFound().build();
}
}
}
Copied!
```
1
listPeople
is a handler function that returns all
Person
objects found in the repository as
JSON.
2
createPerson
is a handler function that stores a new
Person
contained in the request body.
3
getPerson
is a handler function that returns a single person, identified by the
id
path
variable. We retrieve that
Person
from the repository and create a JSON response, if it is
found. If it is not found, we return a 404 Not Found response.
```
class
PersonHandler
(
private
val
repository: PersonRepository) {
fun
listPeople
(request:
ServerRequest
)
: ServerResponse {
(
1
)
val
people: List<Person> = repository.allPeople()
return
ok().contentType(APPLICATION_JSON).body(people);
}
fun
createPerson
(request:
ServerRequest
)
: ServerResponse {
(
2
)
val
person = request.body<Person>()
repository.savePerson(person)
return
ok().build()
}
fun
getPerson
(request:
ServerRequest
)
: ServerResponse {
(
3
)
val
personId = request.pathVariable(
"id"
).toInt()
return
repository.getPerson(personId)?.let { ok().contentType(APPLICATION_JSON).body(it) }
?: ServerResponse.notFound().build()
}
}
Copied!
```

Validation
A functional endpoint can use Spring’s
validation facilities
to
apply validation to the request body. For example, given a custom Spring
Validator
implementation for a
Person
:
Java
Kotlin
```
public
class
PersonHandler
{
private
final
Validator validator =
new
PersonValidator();
(
1
)
// ...
public
ServerResponse
createPerson
(ServerRequest request)
{
Person person = request.body(Person
.
class
)
;
validate(person);
(
2
)
repository.savePerson(person);
return
ok().build();
}
private
void
validate
(Person person)
{
Errors errors =
new
BeanPropertyBindingResult(person,
"person"
);
validator.validate(person, errors);
if
(errors.hasErrors()) {
throw
new
ServerWebInputException(errors.toString());
(
3
)
}
}
}
Copied!
```
1
Create
Validator
instance.
2
Apply validation.
3
Raise exception for a 400 response.
```
class
PersonHandler
(
private
val
repository: PersonRepository) {
private
val
validator = PersonValidator()
(
1
)
// ...
fun
createPerson
(request:
ServerRequest
)
: ServerResponse {
val
person = request.body<Person>()
validate(person)
(
2
)
repository.savePerson(person)
return
ok().build()
}
private
fun
validate
(person:
Person
)
{
val
errors: Errors = BeanPropertyBindingResult(person,
"person"
)
validator.validate(person, errors)
if
(errors.hasErrors()) {
throw
ServerWebInputException(errors.toString())
(
3
)
}
}
}
Copied!
```
1
Create
Validator
instance.
2
Apply validation.
3
Raise exception for a 400 response.
Handlers can also use the standard bean validation API (JSR-303) by creating and injecting
a global
Validator
instance based on
LocalValidatorFactoryBean
.
See
Spring Validation
.
RouterFunction
See equivalent in the Reactive stack
Router functions are used to route the requests to the corresponding
HandlerFunction
.
Typically, you do not write router functions yourself, but rather use a method on the
RouterFunctions
utility class to create one.
RouterFunctions.route()
(no parameters) provides you with a fluent builder for creating a router
function, whereas
RouterFunctions.route(RequestPredicate, HandlerFunction)
offers a direct way
to create a router.
Generally, it is recommended to use the
route()
builder, as it provides
convenient short-cuts for typical mapping scenarios without requiring hard-to-discover
static imports.
For instance, the router function builder offers the method
GET(String, HandlerFunction)
to create a mapping for GET requests; and
POST(String, HandlerFunction)
for POSTs.
Besides HTTP method-based mapping, the route builder offers a way to introduce additional
predicates when mapping to requests.
For each HTTP method there is an overloaded variant that takes a
RequestPredicate
as a
parameter, through which additional constraints can be expressed.
Predicates
You can write your own
RequestPredicate
, but the
RequestPredicates
utility class
offers commonly used implementations, based on the request path, HTTP method, content-type,
and so on.
The following example uses a request predicate to create a constraint based on the
Accept
header:
Java
Kotlin
```
RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route = RouterFunctions.route()
.GET(
"/hello-world"
, accept(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN),
request -> ServerResponse.ok().body(
"Hello World"
)).build();
Copied!
```
```
import
org.springframework.web.servlet.function.router
val
route = router {
GET(
"/hello-world"
, accept(TEXT_PLAIN)) {
ServerResponse.ok().body(
"Hello World"
)
}
}
Copied!
```
You can compose multiple request predicates together by using:
RequestPredicate.and(RequestPredicate)
— both must match.
RequestPredicate.or(RequestPredicate)
— either can match.
Many of the predicates from
RequestPredicates
are composed.
For example,
RequestPredicates.GET(String)
is composed from
RequestPredicates.method(HttpMethod)
and
RequestPredicates.path(String)
.
The example shown above also uses two request predicates, as the builder uses
RequestPredicates.GET
internally, and composes that with the
accept
predicate.
Routes
Router functions are evaluated in order: if the first route does not match, the
second is evaluated, and so on.
Therefore, it makes sense to declare more specific routes before general ones.
This is also important when registering router functions as Spring beans, as will
be described later.
Note that this behavior is different from the annotation-based programming model, where the
"most specific" controller method is picked automatically.
When using the router function builder, all defined routes are composed into one
RouterFunction
that is returned from
build()
.
There are also other ways to compose multiple router functions together:
add(RouterFunction)
on the
RouterFunctions.route()
builder
RouterFunction.and(RouterFunction)
RouterFunction.andRoute(RequestPredicate, HandlerFunction)
— shortcut for
RouterFunction.and()
with nested
RouterFunctions.route()
.
The following example shows the composition of four routes:
Java
Kotlin
```
import
static
org.springframework.http.MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON;
import
static
org.springframework.web.servlet.function.RequestPredicates.*;
PersonRepository repository = ...
PersonHandler handler =
new
PersonHandler(repository);
RouterFunction<ServerResponse> otherRoute = ...
RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route = route()
.GET(
"/person/{id}"
, accept(APPLICATION_JSON), handler::getPerson)
(
1
)
.GET(
"/person"
, accept(APPLICATION_JSON), handler::listPeople)
(
2
)
.POST(
"/person"
, handler::createPerson)
(
3
)
.add(otherRoute)
(
4
)
.build();
Copied!
```
1
GET /person/{id}
with an
Accept
header that matches JSON is routed to
PersonHandler.getPerson
2
GET /person
with an
Accept
header that matches JSON is routed to
PersonHandler.listPeople
3
POST /person
with no additional predicates is mapped to
PersonHandler.createPerson
, and
4
otherRoute
is a router function that is created elsewhere, and added to the route built.
```
import
org.springframework.http.MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON
import
org.springframework.web.servlet.function.router
val
repository: PersonRepository = ...
val
handler = PersonHandler(repository);
val
otherRoute = router {  }
val
route = router {
GET(
"/person/{id}"
, accept(APPLICATION_JSON), handler::getPerson)
(
1
)
GET(
"/person"
, accept(APPLICATION_JSON), handler::listPeople)
(
2
)
POST(
"/person"
, handler::createPerson)
(
3
)
}.and(otherRoute)
(
4
)
Copied!
```
1
GET /person/{id}
with an
Accept
header that matches JSON is routed to
PersonHandler.getPerson
2
GET /person
with an
Accept
header that matches JSON is routed to
PersonHandler.listPeople
3
POST /person
with no additional predicates is mapped to
PersonHandler.createPerson
, and
4
otherRoute
is a router function that is created elsewhere, and added to the route built.
Nested Routes
It is common for a group of router functions to have a shared predicate, for instance a shared
path.
In the example above, the shared predicate would be a path predicate that matches
/person
,
used by three of the routes.
When using annotations, you would remove this duplication by using a type-level
@RequestMapping
annotation that maps to
/person
.
In WebMvc.fn, path predicates can be shared through the
path
method on the router function builder.
For instance, the last few lines of the example above can be improved in the following way by using nested routes:
Java
Kotlin
```
RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route = route()
.path(
"/person"
, builder -> builder
(
1
)
.GET(
"/{id}"
, accept(APPLICATION_JSON), handler::getPerson)
.GET(accept(APPLICATION_JSON), handler::listPeople)
.POST(handler::createPerson))
.build();
Copied!
```
1
Note that second parameter of
path
is a consumer that takes the router builder.
```
import
org.springframework.web.servlet.function.router
val
route = router {
"/person"
.nest {
(
1
)
GET(
"/{id}"
, accept(APPLICATION_JSON), handler::getPerson)
GET(accept(APPLICATION_JSON), handler::listPeople)
POST(handler::createPerson)
}
}
Copied!
```
1
Using
nest
DSL.
Though path-based nesting is the most common, you can nest on any kind of predicate by using
the
nest
method on the builder.
The above still contains some duplication in the form of the shared
Accept
-header predicate.
We can further improve by using the
nest
method together with
accept
:
Java
Kotlin
```
RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route = route()
.path(
"/person"
, b1 -> b1
.nest(accept(APPLICATION_JSON), b2 -> b2
.GET(
"/{id}"
, handler::getPerson)
.GET(handler::listPeople))
.POST(handler::createPerson))
.build();
Copied!
```
```
import
org.springframework.web.servlet.function.router
val
route = router {
"/person"
.nest {
accept(APPLICATION_JSON).nest {
GET(
"/{id}"
, handler::getPerson)
GET(
""
, handler::listPeople)
POST(handler::createPerson)
}
}
}
Copied!
```
Serving Resources
WebMvc.fn provides built-in support for serving resources.
In addition to the capabilities described below, it is possible to implement even more flexible resource handling thanks to
RouterFunctions#resource(java.util.function.Function)
.
Redirecting to a resource
It is possible to redirect requests matching a specified predicate to a resource. This can be useful, for example,
for handling redirects in Single Page Applications.
Java
Kotlin
```
ClassPathResource index =
new
ClassPathResource(
"static/index.html"
);
List<String> extensions = List.of(
"js"
,
"css"
,
"ico"
,
"png"
,
"jpg"
,
"gif"
);
RequestPredicate spaPredicate = path(
"/api/**"
).or(path(
"/error"
)).or(pathExtension(extensions::contains)).negate();
RouterFunction<ServerResponse> redirectToIndex = route()
.resource(spaPredicate, index)
.build();
Copied!
```
```
val
redirectToIndex = router {
val
index = ClassPathResource(
"static/index.html"
)
val
extensions = listOf(
"js"
,
"css"
,
"ico"
,
"png"
,
"jpg"
,
"gif"
)
val
spaPredicate = !(path(
"/api/**"
) or path(
"/error"
) or
pathExtension(extensions::contains))
resource(spaPredicate, index)
}
Copied!
```
Serving resources from a root location
It is also possible to route requests that match a given pattern to resources relative to a given root location.
Java
Kotlin
```
Resource location =
new
FileUrlResource(
"public-resources/"
);
RouterFunction<ServerResponse> resources = RouterFunctions.resources(
"/resources/**"
, location);
Copied!
```
```
val
location = FileUrlResource(
"public-resources/"
)
val
resources = router { resources(
"/resources/**"
, location) }
Copied!
```
Running a Server
See equivalent in the Reactive stack
You typically run router functions in a
DispatcherHandler
-based setup through the
MVC Config
, which uses Spring configuration to declare the
components required to process requests. The MVC Java configuration declares the following
infrastructure components to support functional endpoints:
RouterFunctionMapping
: Detects one or more
RouterFunction<?>
beans in the Spring
configuration,
orders them
, combines them through
RouterFunction.andOther
, and routes requests to the resulting composed
RouterFunction
.
HandlerFunctionAdapter
: Simple adapter that lets
DispatcherHandler
invoke
a
HandlerFunction
that was mapped to a request.
The preceding components let functional endpoints fit within the
DispatcherServlet
request
processing lifecycle and also (potentially) run side by side with annotated controllers, if
any are declared. It is also how functional endpoints are enabled by the Spring Boot Web
starter.
The following example shows a WebFlux Java configuration:
Java
Kotlin
```
@Configuration
@EnableMvc

Filtering Handler Functions
See equivalent in the Reactive stack
You can filter handler functions by using the
before
,
after
, or
filter
methods on the routing
function builder.
With annotations, you can achieve similar functionality by using
@ControllerAdvice
, a
ServletFilter
, or both.
The filter will apply to all routes that are built by the builder.
This means that filters defined in nested routes do not apply to "top-level" routes.
For instance, consider the following example:
Java
Kotlin
```
RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route = route()
.path(
"/person"
, b1 -> b1
.nest(accept(APPLICATION_JSON), b2 -> b2
.GET(
"/{id}"
, handler::getPerson)
.GET(handler::listPeople)
.before(request -> ServerRequest.from(request)
(
1
)
.header(
"X-RequestHeader"
,
"Value"
)
.build()))
.POST(handler::createPerson))
.after((request, response) -> logResponse(response))
(
2
)
.build();
Copied!
```
1
The
before
filter that adds a custom request header is only applied to the two GET routes.
2
The
after
filter that logs the response is applied to all routes, including the nested ones.
```
import
org.springframework.web.servlet.function.router
val
route = router {
"/person"
.nest {
GET(
"/{id}"
, handler::getPerson)
GET(handler::listPeople)
before {
(
1
)
ServerRequest.from(it)
.header(
"X-RequestHeader"
,
"Value"
).build()
}
}
POST(handler::createPerson)
after { _, response ->
(
2
)
logResponse(response)
}
}
Copied!
```
1
The
before
filter that adds a custom request header is only applied to the two GET routes.
2
The
after
filter that logs the response is applied to all routes, including the nested ones.
The
filter
method on the router builder takes a
HandlerFilterFunction
: a
function that takes a
ServerRequest
and
HandlerFunction
and returns a
ServerResponse
.
The handler function parameter represents the next element in the chain.
This is typically the handler that is routed to, but it can also be another
filter if multiple are applied.
Now we can add a simple security filter to our route, assuming that we have a
SecurityManager
that
can determine whether a particular path is allowed.
The following example shows how to do so:
Java
Kotlin
```
SecurityManager securityManager = ...
RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route = route()
.path(
"/person"
, b1 -> b1
.nest(accept(APPLICATION_JSON), b2 -> b2
.GET(
"/{id}"
, handler::getPerson)
.GET(handler::listPeople))
.POST(handler::createPerson))
.filter((request, next) -> {
if
(securityManager.allowAccessTo(request.path())) {
return
next.handle(request);
}
else
{
return
ServerResponse.status(UNAUTHORIZED).build();
}
})
.build();
Copied!
```
```
import
org.springframework.web.servlet.function.router
val
securityManager: SecurityManager = ...
val
route = router {
(
"/person"
and accept(APPLICATION_JSON)).nest {
GET(
"/{id}"
, handler::getPerson)
GET(
""
, handler::listPeople)
POST(handler::createPerson)
filter { request, next ->
if
(securityManager.allowAccessTo(request.path())) {
next(request)
}
else
{
status(UNAUTHORIZED).build();
}
}
}
}
Copied!
```
The preceding example demonstrates that invoking the
next.handle(ServerRequest)
is optional.
We only let the handler function be run when access is allowed.
Besides using the
filter
method on the router function builder, it is possible to apply a
filter to an existing router function via
RouterFunction.filter(HandlerFilterFunction)
.
CORS support for functional endpoints is provided through a dedicated
CorsFilter
.
