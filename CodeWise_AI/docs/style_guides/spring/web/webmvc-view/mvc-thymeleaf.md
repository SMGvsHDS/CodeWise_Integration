Thymeleaf
See equivalent in the Reactive stack
Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine that emphasizes natural HTML
templates that can be previewed in a browser by double-clicking, which is very helpful
for independent work on UI templates (for example, by a designer) without the need for
a running server. If you want to replace JSPs, Thymeleaf offers one of the most
extensive sets of features to make such a transition easier. Thymeleaf is actively
developed and maintained. For a more complete introduction, see the
Thymeleaf
project home page.
The Thymeleaf integration with Spring MVC is managed by the Thymeleaf project.
The configuration involves a few bean declarations, such as
ServletContextTemplateResolver
,
SpringTemplateEngine
, and
ThymeleafViewResolver
.
