REST Clients
This section describes options for client-side access to REST endpoints.
RestClient
RestClient
is a synchronous HTTP client that exposes a modern, fluent API.
See
RestClient
for more details.
WebClient
WebClient
is a reactive client for making HTTP requests with a fluent API.
See
WebClient
for more details.
RestTemplate
RestTemplate
is a synchronous client for making HTTP requests. It is the original
Spring REST client and exposes a simple, template-method API over underlying HTTP client
libraries.
See
RestTemplate
for details.
HTTP Interface
The Spring Framework lets you define an HTTP service as a Java interface with HTTP
exchange methods. You can then generate a proxy that implements this interface and
performs the exchanges. This helps to simplify HTTP remote access and provides additional
flexibility for choosing an API style such as synchronous or reactive.
See
HTTP Interface
for details.
