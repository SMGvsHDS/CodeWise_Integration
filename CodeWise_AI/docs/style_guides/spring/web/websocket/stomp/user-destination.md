User Destinations
An application can send messages that target a specific user, and Spring’s STOMP support
recognizes destinations prefixed with
/user/
for this purpose.
For example, a client might subscribe to the
/user/queue/position-updates
destination.
UserDestinationMessageHandler
handles this destination and transforms it into a
destination unique to the user session (such as
/queue/position-updates-user123
).
This provides the convenience of subscribing to a generically named destination while,
at the same time, ensuring no collisions with other users who subscribe to the same
destination so that each user can receive unique stock position updates.
When working with user destinations, it is important to configure broker and
application destination prefixes as shown in
Enable STOMP
, or otherwise the
broker would handle "/user" prefixed messages that should only be handled by
UserDestinationMessageHandler
.
On the sending side, messages can be sent to a destination such as
/user/{username}/queue/position-updates
, which in turn is translated
by the
UserDestinationMessageHandler
into one or more destinations, one for each
session associated with the user. This lets any component within the application
send messages that target a specific user without necessarily knowing anything more
than their name and the generic destination. This is also supported through an
annotation and a messaging template.
A message-handling method can send messages to the user associated with
the message being handled through the
@SendToUser
annotation (also supported on
the class-level to share a common destination), as the following example shows:
```
@Controller
public
class
PortfolioController
{
@MessageMapping
(
"/trade"
)
@SendToUser
(
"/queue/position-updates"
)
public
TradeResult
executeTrade
(Trade trade, Principal principal)
{
// ...
return
tradeResult;
}
}
Copied!
```
If the user has more than one session, by default, all of the sessions subscribed
to the given destination are targeted. However, sometimes, it may be necessary to
target only the session that sent the message being handled. You can do so by
setting the
broadcast
attribute to false, as the following example shows:
```
@Controller
public
class
MyController
{
@MessageMapping
(
"/action"
)
public
void
handleAction
()
throws
Exception
{
// raise MyBusinessException here
}
@MessageExceptionHandler
@SendToUser
(destinations=
"/queue/errors"
, broadcast=
false
)
public
ApplicationError
handleException
(MyBusinessException exception)
{
// ...
return
appError;
}
}
Copied!
```
While user destinations generally imply an authenticated user, it is not strictly required.
A WebSocket session that is not associated with an authenticated user
can subscribe to a user destination. In such cases, the
@SendToUser
annotation
behaves exactly the same as with
broadcast=false
(that is, targeting only the
session that sent the message being handled).
You can send a message to user destinations from any application
component by, for example, injecting the
SimpMessagingTemplate
created by the Java configuration or
the XML namespace. (The bean name is
brokerMessagingTemplate
if required
for qualification with
@Qualifier
.) The following example shows how to do so:
```
@Service
public
class
TradeServiceImpl
implements
TradeService
{
private
final
SimpMessagingTemplate messagingTemplate;
@Autowired
public
TradeServiceImpl
(SimpMessagingTemplate messagingTemplate)
{
this
.messagingTemplate = messagingTemplate;
}
// ...
public
void
afterTradeExecuted
(Trade trade)
{
this
.messagingTemplate.convertAndSendToUser(
trade.getUserName(),
"/queue/position-updates"
, trade.getResult());
}
}
Copied!
```
When you use user destinations with an external message broker, you should check the broker
documentation on how to manage inactive queues, so that, when the user session is
over, all unique user queues are removed. For example, RabbitMQ creates auto-delete
queues when you use destinations such as
/exchange/amq.direct/position-updates
.
So, in that case, the client could subscribe to
/user/exchange/amq.direct/position-updates
.
Similarly, ActiveMQ has
configuration options
for purging inactive destinations.
In a multi-application server scenario, a user destination may remain unresolved because
the user is connected to a different server. In such cases, you can configure a
destination to broadcast unresolved messages so that other servers have a chance to try.
This can be done through the
userDestinationBroadcast
property of the
MessageBrokerRegistry
in Java configuration and the
user-destination-broadcast
attribute
of the
message-broker
element in XML.
