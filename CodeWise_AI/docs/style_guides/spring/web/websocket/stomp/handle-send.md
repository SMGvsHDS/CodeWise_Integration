Sending Messages
What if you want to send messages to connected clients from any part of the
application? Any application component can send messages to the
brokerChannel
.
The easiest way to do so is to inject a
SimpMessagingTemplate
and
use it to send messages. Typically, you would inject it by
type, as the following example shows:
```
@Controller
public
class
GreetingController
{
private
SimpMessagingTemplate template;
@Autowired
public
GreetingController
(SimpMessagingTemplate template)
{
this
.template = template;
}
@RequestMapping
(path=
"/greetings"
, method=POST)
public
void
greet
(String greeting)
{
String text =
"["
+ getTimestamp() +
"]:"
+ greeting;
this
.template.convertAndSend(
"/topic/greetings"
, text);
}
}
Copied!
```
However, you can also qualify it by its name (
brokerMessagingTemplate
), if another
bean of the same type exists.
