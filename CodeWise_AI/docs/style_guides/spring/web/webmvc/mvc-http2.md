HTTP/2
See equivalent in the Reactive stack
Servlet 4 containers are required to support HTTP/2, and Spring Framework 5 is compatible
with Servlet API 4. From a programming model perspective, there is nothing specific that
applications need to do. However, there are considerations related to server configuration.
For more details, see the
HTTP/2 wiki page
.
The Servlet API does expose one construct related to HTTP/2. You can use the
jakarta.servlet.http.PushBuilder
to proactively push resources to clients, and it
is supported as a
method argument
to
@RequestMapping
methods.
