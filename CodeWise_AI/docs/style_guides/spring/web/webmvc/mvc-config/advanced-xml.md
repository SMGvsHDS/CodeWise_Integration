Advanced XML Config
The MVC namespace does not have an advanced mode. If you need to customize a property on
a bean that you cannot change otherwise, you can use the
BeanPostProcessor
lifecycle
hook of the Spring
ApplicationContext
, as the following example shows:
Java
Kotlin
```
@Component
public
class
MyPostProcessor
implements
BeanPostProcessor
{
public
Object
postProcessBeforeInitialization
(Object bean, String name)
throws
BeansException
{
// ...
return
bean;
}
}
Copied!
```
```
@Component
class
MyPostProcessor
:
BeanPostProcessor {
override
fun
postProcessBeforeInitialization
(bean:
Any
, name:
String
)
: Any {
// ...
return
bean
}
}
Copied!
```
Note that you need to declare
MyPostProcessor
as a bean, either explicitly in XML or
by letting it be detected through a
<component-scan/>
declaration.
