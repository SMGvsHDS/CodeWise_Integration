Controller Advice
See equivalent in the Reactive stack
@ExceptionHandler
,
@InitBinder
, and
@ModelAttribute
methods apply only to the
@Controller
class, or class hierarchy, in which they are declared. If, instead, they
are declared in an
@ControllerAdvice
or
@RestControllerAdvice
class, then they apply
to any controller. Moreover, as of 5.3,
@ExceptionHandler
methods in
@ControllerAdvice
can be used to handle exceptions from any
@Controller
or any other handler.
@ControllerAdvice
is meta-annotated with
@Component
and therefore can be registered as
a Spring bean through
component scanning
.
@RestControllerAdvice
is a shortcut annotation that combines
@ControllerAdvice
with
@ResponseBody
, in effect simply an
@ControllerAdvice
whose exception handler
methods render to the response body.
On startup,
RequestMappingHandlerMapping
and
ExceptionHandlerExceptionResolver
detect
controller advice beans and apply them at runtime. Global
@ExceptionHandler
methods,
from an
@ControllerAdvice
, are applied
after
local ones, from the
@Controller
.
By contrast, global
@ModelAttribute
and
@InitBinder
methods are applied
before
local ones.
By default, both
@ControllerAdvice
and
@RestControllerAdvice
apply to any controller,
including
@Controller
and
@RestController
. Use attributes of the annotation to narrow
the set of controllers and handlers that they apply to. For example:
Java
Kotlin
```
// Target all Controllers annotated with @RestController
@ControllerAdvice
(annotations = RestController
.
class
)
public
class
ExampleAdvice1
{}
// Target all Controllers within specific packages
@ControllerAdvice
(
"org.example.controllers"
)
public
class
ExampleAdvice2
{}
// Target all Controllers assignable to specific classes
@ControllerAdvice
(assignableTypes = {ControllerInterface
.
class
,
AbstractController
.
class
})
public
class
ExampleAdvice3
{}
Copied!
```
```
// Target all Controllers annotated with @RestController
@ControllerAdvice(annotations = [RestController::class])
class
ExampleAdvice1
// Target all Controllers within specific packages
@ControllerAdvice(
"org.example.controllers"
)
class
ExampleAdvice2
// Target all Controllers assignable to specific classes
@ControllerAdvice(assignableTypes = [ControllerInterface::class, AbstractController::class])
class
ExampleAdvice3
Copied!
```
The selectors in the preceding example are evaluated at runtime and may negatively impact
performance if used extensively. See the
@ControllerAdvice
javadoc for more details.
