Exceptions
See equivalent in the Reactive stack
@Controller
and
@ControllerAdvice
classes can have
@ExceptionHandler
methods to handle exceptions from controller methods, as the following example shows:
Java
Kotlin
```
import
java.io.IOException;
import
org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import
org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import
org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ExceptionHandler;
@Controller
public
class
SimpleController
{
@ExceptionHandler
(IOException
.
class
)
public
ResponseEntity
<
String
>
handle
()
{
return
ResponseEntity.internalServerError().body(
"Could not read file storage"
);
}
}
Copied!
```
```
import
org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity
import
org.springframework.stereotype.Controller
import
org.springframework.web.bind.
annotation
.ExceptionHandler
import
java.io.IOException
@Controller
class
SimpleController
{
@ExceptionHandler(IOException::class)
fun
handle
()
: ResponseEntity<String> {
return
ResponseEntity.internalServerError().body(
"Could not read file storage"
)
}
}
Copied!
```
Exception Mapping
The exception may match against a top-level exception being propagated (for example, a direct
IOException
being thrown) or against a nested cause within a wrapper exception (for example,
an
IOException
wrapped inside an
IllegalStateException
). As of 5.3, this can match
at arbitrary cause levels, whereas previously only an immediate cause was considered.
For matching exception types, preferably declare the target exception as a method argument,
as the preceding example shows. When multiple exception methods match, a root exception match is
generally preferred to a cause exception match. More specifically, the
ExceptionDepthComparator
is used to sort exceptions based on their depth from the thrown exception type.
Alternatively, the annotation declaration may narrow the exception types to match,
as the following example shows:
Java
Kotlin
```
@ExceptionHandler
({FileSystemException
.
class
,
RemoteException
.
class
})
public
ResponseEntity
<
String
>
handleIoException
(
IOException
ex
)
{
return
ResponseEntity.internalServerError().body(ex.getMessage());
}
Copied!
```
```
@ExceptionHandler(FileSystemException::class, RemoteException::class)
fun
handleIoException
(ex:
IOException
)
: ResponseEntity<String> {
return
ResponseEntity.internalServerError().body(ex.message)
}
Copied!
```
You can even use a list of specific exception types with a very generic argument signature,
as the following example shows:
Java
Kotlin
```
@ExceptionHandler
({FileSystemException
.
class
,
RemoteException
.
class
})
public
ResponseEntity
<
String
>
handleExceptions
(
Exception
ex
)
{
return
ResponseEntity.internalServerError().body(ex.getMessage());
}
Copied!
```
```
@ExceptionHandler(FileSystemException::class, RemoteException::class)
fun
handleExceptions
(ex:
Exception
)
: ResponseEntity<String> {
return
ResponseEntity.internalServerError().body(ex.message)
}
Copied!
```
The distinction between root and cause exception matching can be surprising.
In the
IOException
variant shown earlier, the method is typically called with
the actual
FileSystemException
or
RemoteException
instance as the argument,
since both of them extend from
IOException
. However, if any such matching
exception is propagated within a wrapper exception which is itself an
IOException
,
the passed-in exception instance is that wrapper exception.
The behavior is even simpler in the
handle(Exception)
variant. This is
always invoked with the wrapper exception in a wrapping scenario, with the
actually matching exception to be found through
ex.getCause()
in that case.
The passed-in exception is the actual
FileSystemException
or
RemoteException
instance only when these are thrown as top-level exceptions.
We generally recommend that you be as specific as possible in the argument signature,
reducing the potential for mismatches between root and cause exception types.
Consider breaking a multi-matching method into individual
@ExceptionHandler
methods, each matching a single specific exception type through its signature.
In a multi-
@ControllerAdvice
arrangement, we recommend declaring your primary root exception
mappings on a
@ControllerAdvice
prioritized with a corresponding order. While a root
exception match is preferred to a cause, this is defined among the methods of a given
controller or
@ControllerAdvice
class. This means a cause match on a higher-priority
@ControllerAdvice
bean is preferred to any match (for example, root) on a lower-priority
@ControllerAdvice
bean.
Last but not least, an
@ExceptionHandler
method implementation can choose to back
out of dealing with a given exception instance by rethrowing it in its original form.
This is useful in scenarios where you are interested only in root-level matches or in
matches within a specific context that cannot be statically determined. A rethrown
exception is propagated through the remaining resolution chain, as though
the given
@ExceptionHandler
method would not have matched in the first place.
Support for
@ExceptionHandler
methods in Spring MVC is built on the
DispatcherServlet
level,
HandlerExceptionResolver
mechanism.
Media Type Mapping
See equivalent in the Reactive stack
In addition to exception types,
@ExceptionHandler
methods can also declare producible media types.
This allows to refine error responses depending on the media types requested by HTTP clients, typically in the "Accept" HTTP request header.
Applications can declare producible media types directly on annotations, for the same exception type:
Java
Kotlin
```
@ExceptionHandler
(produces =
"application/json"
)
public
ResponseEntity<ErrorMessage>
handleJson
(IllegalArgumentException exc)
{
return
ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(
new
ErrorMessage(exc.getMessage(),
42
));
}
@ExceptionHandler
(produces =
"text/html"
)
public
String
handle
(IllegalArgumentException exc, Model model)
{
model.addAttribute(
"error"
,
new
ErrorMessage(exc.getMessage(),
42
));
return
"errorView"
;
}
Copied!
```
```
@ExceptionHandler(produces = [
"application/json"
])
fun
handleJson
(exc:
IllegalArgumentException
)
: ResponseEntity<ErrorMessage> {
return
ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(ErrorMessage(exc.message,
42
))
}
@ExceptionHandler(produces = [
"text/html"
])
fun
handle
(exc:
IllegalArgumentException
, model:
Model
)
: String {
model.addAttribute(
"error"
, ErrorMessage(exc.message,
42
))
return
"errorView"
}
Copied!
```
Here, methods handle the same exception type but will not be rejected as duplicates.
Instead, API clients requesting "application/json" will receive a JSON error, and browsers will get an HTML error view.
Each
@ExceptionHandler
annotation can declare several producible media types,
the content negotiation during the error handling phase will decide which content type will be used.
Method Arguments
See equivalent in the Reactive stack
@ExceptionHandler
methods support the following arguments:
Method argument
Description
Exception type
For access to the raised exception.
HandlerMethod
For access to the controller method that raised the exception.
WebRequest
,
NativeWebRequest
Generic access to request parameters and request and session attributes without direct
use of the Servlet API.
jakarta.servlet.ServletRequest
,
jakarta.servlet.ServletResponse
Choose any specific request or response type (for example,
ServletRequest
or
HttpServletRequest
or Spring’s
MultipartRequest
or
MultipartHttpServletRequest
).
jakarta.servlet.http.HttpSession
Enforces the presence of a session. As a consequence, such an argument is never
null
.
Note that session access is not thread-safe. Consider setting the
RequestMappingHandlerAdapter
instance’s
synchronizeOnSession
flag to
true
if multiple
requests are allowed to access a session concurrently.
java.security.Principal
Currently authenticated user — possibly a specific
Principal
implementation class if known.
HttpMethod
The HTTP method of the request.
java.util.Locale
The current request locale, determined by the most specific
LocaleResolver
available — in
effect, the configured
LocaleResolver
or
LocaleContextResolver
.
java.util.TimeZone
,
java.time.ZoneId
The time zone associated with the current request, as determined by a
LocaleContextResolver
.
java.io.OutputStream
,
java.io.Writer
For access to the raw response body, as exposed by the Servlet API.
java.util.Map
,
org.springframework.ui.Model
,
org.springframework.ui.ModelMap
For access to the model for an error response. Always empty.
RedirectAttributes
Specify attributes to use in case of a redirect — (that is to be appended to the query
string) and flash attributes to be stored temporarily until the request after the redirect.
See
Redirect Attributes
and
Flash Attributes
.
@SessionAttribute
For access to any session attribute, in contrast to model attributes stored in the
session as a result of a class-level
@SessionAttributes
declaration.
See
@SessionAttribute
for more details.
@RequestAttribute
For access to request attributes. See
@RequestAttribute
for more details.
Return Values
See equivalent in the Reactive stack
@ExceptionHandler
methods support the following return values:
Return value
Description
@ResponseBody
The return value is converted through
HttpMessageConverter
instances and written to the
response. See
@ResponseBody
.
HttpEntity<B>
,
ResponseEntity<B>
The return value specifies that the full response (including the HTTP headers and the body)
be converted through
HttpMessageConverter
instances and written to the response.
See
ResponseEntity
.
ErrorResponse
,
ProblemDetail
To render an RFC 9457 error response with details in the body,
see
Error Responses
String
A view name to be resolved with
ViewResolver
implementations and used together with the
implicit model — determined through command objects and
@ModelAttribute
methods.
The handler method can also programmatically enrich the model by declaring a
Model
argument (described earlier).
View
A
View
instance to use for rendering together with the implicit model — determined
through command objects and
@ModelAttribute
methods. The handler method may also
programmatically enrich the model by declaring a
Model
argument (descried earlier).
java.util.Map
,
org.springframework.ui.Model
Attributes to be added to the implicit model with the view name implicitly determined
through a
RequestToViewNameTranslator
.
@ModelAttribute
An attribute to be added to the model with the view name implicitly determined through
a
RequestToViewNameTranslator
.
Note that
@ModelAttribute
is optional. See “Any other return value” at the end of
this table.
ModelAndView
object
The view and model attributes to use and, optionally, a response status.
void
A method with a
void
return type (or
null
return value) is considered to have fully
handled the response if it also has a
ServletResponse
an
OutputStream
argument, or
a
@ResponseStatus
annotation. The same is also true if the controller has made a positive
ETag
or
lastModified
timestamp check (see
Controllers
for details).
If none of the above is true, a
void
return type can also indicate “no response body” for
REST controllers or default view name selection for HTML controllers.
Any other return value
If a return value is not matched to any of the above and is not a simple type (as determined by
BeanUtils#isSimpleProperty
),
by default, it is treated as a model attribute to be added to the model. If it is a simple type,
it remains unresolved.
