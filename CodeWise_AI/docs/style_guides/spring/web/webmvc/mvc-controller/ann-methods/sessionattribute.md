@SessionAttribute
See equivalent in the Reactive stack
If you need access to pre-existing session attributes that are managed globally
(that is, outside the controller — for example, by a filter) and may or may not be present,
you can use the
@SessionAttribute
annotation on a method parameter,
as the following example shows:
Java
Kotlin
```
@RequestMapping
(
"/"
)
public
String
handle
(@SessionAttribute User user)
{
(
1
)
// ...
}
Copied!
```

Using a
@SessionAttribute
annotation.
```
@RequestMapping(
"/"
)
fun
handle
(
@SessionAttribute
user:
User
)
: String {
(
1
)
// ...
}
Copied!
```

Using a
@SessionAttribute
annotation.======
For use cases that require adding or removing session attributes, consider injecting
org.springframework.web.context.request.WebRequest
or
jakarta.servlet.http.HttpSession
into the controller method.
For temporary storage of model attributes in the session as part of a controller
workflow, consider using
@SessionAttributes
as described in
@SessionAttributes
.
