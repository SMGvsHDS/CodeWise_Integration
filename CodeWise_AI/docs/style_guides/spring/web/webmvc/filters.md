Filters
See equivalent in the Reactive stack
The
spring-web
module provides some useful filters:
Form Data
Forwarded Headers
Shallow ETag
CORS
URL Handler
Servlet filters can be configured in the
web.xml
configuration file or using Servlet annotations.
If you are using Spring Boot, you can
declare them as beans and configure them as part of your application
.
Form Data
Browsers can submit form data only through HTTP GET or HTTP POST but non-browser clients can also
use HTTP PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. The Servlet API requires
ServletRequest.getParameter*()
methods to support form field access only for HTTP POST.
The
spring-web
module provides
FormContentFilter
to intercept HTTP PUT, PATCH, and DELETE
requests with a content type of
application/x-www-form-urlencoded
, read the form data from
the body of the request, and wrap the
ServletRequest
to make the form data
available through the
ServletRequest.getParameter*()
family of methods.
Forwarded Headers
See equivalent in the Reactive stack
As a request goes through proxies such as load balancers the host, port, and
scheme may change, and that makes it a challenge to create links that point to the correct
host, port, and scheme from a client perspective.
RFC 7239
defines the
Forwarded
HTTP header
that proxies can use to provide information about the original request.
Non-standard Headers
There are other non-standard headers, too, including
X-Forwarded-Host
,
X-Forwarded-Port
,
X-Forwarded-Proto
,
X-Forwarded-Ssl
, and
X-Forwarded-Prefix
.
X-Forwarded-Host
While not standard,
X-Forwarded-Host: <host>
is a de-facto standard header that is used to communicate the original host to a
downstream server. For example, if a request of
example.com/resource
is sent to
a proxy which forwards the request to
localhost:8080/resource
, then a header of
X-Forwarded-Host: example.com
can be sent to inform the server that the original host was
example.com
.
X-Forwarded-Port
While not standard,
X-Forwarded-Port: <port>
is a de-facto standard header that is used to
communicate the original port to a downstream server. For example, if a request of
example.com/resource
is sent to a proxy which forwards the request to
localhost:8080/resource
, then a header of
X-Forwarded-Port: 443
can be sent
to inform the server that the original port was
443
.
X-Forwarded-Proto
While not standard,
X-Forwarded-Proto: (https|http)
is a de-facto standard header that is used to communicate the original protocol (for example, https / http)
to a downstream server. For example, if a request of
example.com/resource
is sent to
a proxy which forwards the request to
localhost:8080/resource
, then a header of
X-Forwarded-Proto: https
can be sent to inform the server that the original protocol was
https
.
X-Forwarded-Ssl
While not standard,
X-Forwarded-Ssl: (on|off)
is a de-facto standard header that is used to communicate the
original protocol (for example, https / https) to a downstream server. For example, if a request of
example.com/resource
is sent to a proxy which forwards the request to
localhost:8080/resource
, then a header of
X-Forwarded-Ssl: on
to inform the server that the
original protocol was
https
.
X-Forwarded-Prefix
While not standard,
X-Forwarded-Prefix: <prefix>
is a de-facto standard header that is used to communicate the original URL path prefix to a
downstream server.
Use of
X-Forwarded-Prefix
can vary by deployment scenario, and needs to be flexible to
allow replacing, removing, or prepending the path prefix of the target server.
Scenario 1: Override path prefix
```
https://example.com/api/{path} -> http://localhost:8080/app1/{path}
```
The prefix is the start of the path before the capture group
{path}
. For the proxy,
the prefix is
/api
while for the server the prefix is
/app1
. In this case, the proxy
can send
X-Forwarded-Prefix: /api
to have the original prefix
/api
override the
server prefix
/app1
.
Scenario 2: Remove path prefix
At times, an application may want to have the prefix removed. For example, consider the
following proxy to server mapping:
```
https://app1.example.com/{path} -> http://localhost:8080/app1/{path}
https://app2.example.com/{path} -> http://localhost:8080/app2/{path}
```
The proxy has no prefix, while applications
app1
and
app2
have path prefixes
/app1
and
/app2
respectively. The proxy can send
X-Forwarded-Prefix:
to
have the empty prefix override server prefixes
/app1
and
/app2
.
A common case for this deployment scenario is where licenses are paid per
production application server, and it is preferable to deploy multiple applications per
server to reduce fees. Another reason is to run more applications on the same server in
order to share the resources required by the server to run.
In these scenarios, applications need a non-empty context root because there are multiple
applications on the same server. However, this should not be visible in URL paths of
the public API where applications may use different subdomains that provides benefits
such as:
Added security, for example, same origin policy
Independent scaling of applications (different domain points to different IP address)
Scenario 3: Insert path prefix
In other cases, it may be necessary to prepend a prefix. For example, consider the
following proxy to server mapping:
```
https://example.com/api/app1/{path} -> http://localhost:8080/app1/{path}
```
In this case, the proxy has a prefix of
/api/app1
and the server has a prefix of
/app1
. The proxy can send
X-Forwarded-Prefix: /api/app1
to have the original prefix
/api/app1
override the server prefix
/app1
.
ForwardedHeaderFilter
ForwardedHeaderFilter
is a Servlet filter that modifies the request in order to
a) change the host, port, and scheme based on
Forwarded
headers, and b) to remove those
headers to eliminate further impact. The filter relies on wrapping the request, and
therefore it must be ordered ahead of other filters, such as
RequestContextFilter
, that
should work with the modified and not the original request.
Security Considerations
There are security considerations for forwarded headers since an application cannot know
if the headers were added by a proxy, as intended, or by a malicious client. This is why
a proxy at the boundary of trust should be configured to remove untrusted
Forwarded
headers that come from the outside. You can also configure the
ForwardedHeaderFilter
with
removeOnly=true
, in which case it removes but does not use the headers.
Dispatcher Types
In order to support
asynchronous requests
and error dispatches this
filter should be mapped with
DispatcherType.ASYNC
and also
DispatcherType.ERROR
.
If using Spring Framework’s
AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer
(see
Servlet Config
) all filters are automatically registered for all dispatch
types. However if registering the filter via
web.xml
or in Spring Boot via a
FilterRegistrationBean
be sure to include
DispatcherType.ASYNC
and
DispatcherType.ERROR
in addition to
DispatcherType.REQUEST
.
Shallow ETag
The
ShallowEtagHeaderFilter
filter creates a “shallow” ETag by caching the content
written to the response and computing an MD5 hash from it. The next time a client sends,
it does the same, but it also compares the computed value against the
If-None-Match
request header and, if the two are equal, returns a 304 (NOT_MODIFIED).
This strategy saves network bandwidth but not CPU, as the full response must be computed for each request.
State-changing HTTP methods and other HTTP conditional request headers such as
If-Match
and
If-Unmodified-Since
are outside the scope of this filter. Other strategies at the controller level
can avoid the computation and have a broader support for HTTP conditional requests.
See
HTTP Caching
.
This filter has a
writeWeakETag
parameter that configures the filter to write weak ETags
similar to the following:
W/"02a2d595e6ed9a0b24f027f2b63b134d6"
(as defined in
RFC 7232 Section 2.3
).
In order to support
asynchronous requests
this filter must be mapped
with
DispatcherType.ASYNC
so that the filter can delay and successfully generate an
ETag to the end of the last async dispatch. If using Spring Framework’s
AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer
(see
Servlet Config
)
all filters are automatically registered for all dispatch types. However if registering
the filter via
web.xml
or in Spring Boot via a
FilterRegistrationBean
be sure to include
DispatcherType.ASYNC
.
CORS
See equivalent in the Reactive stack
Spring MVC provides fine-grained support for CORS configuration through annotations on
controllers. However, when used with Spring Security, we advise relying on the built-in
CorsFilter
that must be ordered ahead of Spring Security’s chain of filters.
See the sections on
CORS
and the
CORS Filter
for more details.
URL Handler
See equivalent in the Reactive stack
In previous Spring Framework versions, Spring MVC could be configured to ignore trailing slashes in URL paths
when mapping incoming requests on controller methods. This could be done by enabling the
setUseTrailingSlashMatch
option on the
PathMatchConfigurer
. This means that sending a "GET /home/" request would be handled by a controller
method annotated with
@GetMapping("/home")
.
This option has been retired, but applications are still expected to handle such requests in a safe way.
The
UrlHandlerFilter
Servlet filter has been designed for this purpose. It can be configured to:
respond with an HTTP redirect status when receiving URLs with trailing slashes, sending browsers to the non-trailing slash URL variant.
wrap the request to act as if the request was sent without a trailing slash and continue the processing of the request.
Here is how you can instantiate and configure a
UrlHandlerFilter
for a blog application:
Java
Kotlin
```
UrlHandlerFilter urlHandlerFilter = UrlHandlerFilter
// will HTTP 308 redirect "/blog/my-blog-post/" -> "/blog/my-blog-post"
.trailingSlashHandler(
"/blog/**"
).redirect(HttpStatus.PERMANENT_REDIRECT)
// will wrap the request to "/admin/user/account/" and make it as "/admin/user/account"
.trailingSlashHandler(
"/admin/**"
).wrapRequest()
.build();
Copied!
```
```
val
urlHandlerFilter = UrlHandlerFilter
// will HTTP 308 redirect "/blog/my-blog-post/" -> "/blog/my-blog-post"
.trailingSlashHandler(
"/blog/**"
).redirect(HttpStatus.PERMANENT_REDIRECT)
// will wrap the request to "/admin/user/account/" and make it as "/admin/user/account"
.trailingSlashHandler(
"/admin/**"
).wrapRequest()
.build()
Copied!
```
