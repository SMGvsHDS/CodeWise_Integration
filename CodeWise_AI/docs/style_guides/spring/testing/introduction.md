Introduction to Spring Testing
Testing is an integral part of enterprise software development. This chapter focuses on
the value added by the IoC principle to
unit testing
and on the benefits
of the Spring Framework’s support for
integration testing
. (A
thorough treatment of testing in the enterprise is beyond the scope of this reference
manual.)
