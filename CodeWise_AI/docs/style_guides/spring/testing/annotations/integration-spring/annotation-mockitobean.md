@MockitoBean
and
@MockitoSpyBean
@MockitoBean
and
@MockitoSpyBean
can be used in test classes to override a bean in the test’s
ApplicationContext
with a
Mockito
mock
or
spy
, respectively. In the latter case, an early instance of the
original bean is captured and wrapped by the spy.
The annotations can be applied in the following ways.
On a non-static field in a test class or any of its superclasses.
On a non-static field in an enclosing class for a
@Nested
test class or in any class
in the type hierarchy or enclosing class hierarchy above the
@Nested
test class.
At the type level on a test class or any superclass or implemented interface in the
type hierarchy above the test class.
At the type level on an enclosing class for a
@Nested
test class or on any class or
interface in the type hierarchy or enclosing class hierarchy above the
@Nested
test
class.
When
@MockitoBean
or
@MockitoSpyBean
is declared on a field, the bean to mock or spy
is inferred from the type of the annotated field. If multiple candidates exist in the
ApplicationContext
, a
@Qualifier
annotation can be declared on the field to help
disambiguate. In the absence of a
@Qualifier
annotation, the name of the annotated
field will be used as a
fallback qualifier
. Alternatively, you can explicitly specify a
bean name to mock or spy by setting the
value
or
name
attribute in the annotation.
When
@MockitoBean
or
@MockitoSpyBean
is declared at the type level, the type of bean
(or beans) to mock or spy must be supplied via the
types
attribute in the annotation –
for example,
@MockitoBean(types = {OrderService.class, UserService.class})
. If multiple
candidates exist in the
ApplicationContext
, you can explicitly specify a bean name to
mock or spy by setting the
name
attribute. Note, however, that the
types
attribute
must contain a single type if an explicit bean
name
is configured – for example,
@MockitoBean(name = "ps1", types = PrintingService.class)
.
To support reuse of mock configuration,
@MockitoBean
and
@MockitoSpyBean
may be used
as meta-annotations to create custom
composed annotations
– for example, to define
common mock or spy configuration in a single annotation that can be reused across a test
suite.
@MockitoBean
and
@MockitoSpyBean
can also be used as repeatable annotations at
the type level — for example, to mock or spy several beans by name.
Qualifiers, including the name of a field, are used to determine if a separate
ApplicationContext
needs to be created. If you are using this feature to mock or spy
the same bean in several test classes, make sure to name the fields consistently to avoid
creating unnecessary contexts.
Using
@MockitoBean
or
@MockitoSpyBean
in conjunction with
@ContextHierarchy
can
lead to undesirable results since each
@MockitoBean
or
@MockitoSpyBean
will be
applied to all context hierarchy levels by default. To ensure that a particular
@MockitoBean
or
@MockitoSpyBean
is applied to a single context hierarchy level, set
the
contextName
attribute to match a configured
@ContextConfiguration
name – for
example,
@MockitoBean(contextName = "app-config")
or
@MockitoSpyBean(contextName = "app-config")
.
See
context
hierarchies with bean overrides
for further details and examples.
Each annotation also defines Mockito-specific attributes to fine-tune the mocking behavior.
The
@MockitoBean
annotation uses the
REPLACE_OR_CREATE
strategy for bean overrides
.
If a corresponding bean does not exist, a new bean will be created. However, you can
switch to the
REPLACE
strategy by setting the
enforceOverride
attribute to
true
–
for example,
@MockitoBean(enforceOverride = true)
.
The
@MockitoSpyBean
annotation uses the
WRAP
strategy
,
and the original instance is wrapped in a Mockito spy. This strategy requires that
exactly one candidate bean exists.
As stated in the documentation for Mockito, there are times when using
Mockito.when()
is
inappropriate for stubbing a spy – for example, if calling a real method on a spy results
in undesired side effects.
To avoid such undesired side effects, consider using
Mockito.doReturn(…​).when(spy)…​
,
Mockito.doThrow(…​).when(spy)…​
,
Mockito.doNothing().when(spy)…​
, and similar methods.
Only
singleton
beans can be overridden. Any attempt to override a non-singleton bean
will result in an exception.
When using
@MockitoBean
to mock a bean created by a
FactoryBean
, the
FactoryBean
will be replaced with a singleton mock of the type of object created by the
FactoryBean
.
When using
@MockitoSpyBean
to create a spy for a
FactoryBean
, a spy will be created
for the object created by the
FactoryBean
, not for the
FactoryBean
itself.
There are no restrictions on the visibility of
@MockitoBean
and
@MockitoSpyBean
fields.
Such fields can therefore be
public
,
protected
, package-private (default visibility),
or
private
depending on the needs or coding practices of the project.
@MockitoBean
Examples
The following example shows how to use the default behavior of the
@MockitoBean
annotation.
Java
```
@SpringJUnitConfig
(TestConfig
.
class
)
class
BeanOverrideTests
{
@MockitoBean
(
1
)
CustomService customService;
// tests...
}
Copied!
```

Replace the bean with type
CustomService
with a Mockito mock.
In the example above, we are creating a mock for
CustomService
. If more than one bean
of that type exists, the bean named
customService
is considered. Otherwise, the test
will fail, and you will need to provide a qualifier of some sort to identify which of the
CustomService
beans you want to override. If no such bean exists, a bean will be
created with an auto-generated bean name.
The following example uses a by-name lookup, rather than a by-type lookup. If no bean
named
service
exists, one is created.
Java
```
@SpringJUnitConfig
(TestConfig
.
class
)
class
BeanOverrideTests
{
@MockitoBean
(
"service"
)
(
1
)
CustomService customService;
// tests...
}
Copied!
```

Replace the bean named
service
with a Mockito mock.
The following
@SharedMocks
annotation registers two mocks by-type and one mock by-name.
Java
```
@Target
(ElementType.TYPE)
@Retention
(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@MockitoBean
(types = {OrderService
.
class
,
UserService
.
class
})
(1)
@
MockitoBean
(
name
=
"ps1"
, types = PrintingService
.
class
)
(2)
public
@
interface
SharedMocks
{
}
Copied!
```
1
Register
OrderService
and
UserService
mocks by-type.
2
Register
PrintingService
mock by-name.
The following demonstrates how
@SharedMocks
can be used on a test class.
Java
```
@SpringJUnitConfig
(TestConfig
.
class
)
@
SharedMocks
(1)
class
BeanOverrideTests
{
@Autowired
OrderService orderService;
(
2
)
@Autowired
UserService userService;
(
2
)
@Autowired
PrintingService ps1;
(
2
)
// Inject other components that rely on the mocks.
@Test
void
testThatDependsOnMocks
()
{
// ...
}
}
Copied!
```
1
Register common mocks via the custom
@SharedMocks
annotation.
2
Optionally inject mocks to
stub
or
verify
them.
The mocks can also be injected into
@Configuration
classes or other test-related
components in the
ApplicationContext
in order to configure them with Mockito’s stubbing
APIs.
@MockitoSpyBean
Examples
The following example shows how to use the default behavior of the
@MockitoSpyBean
annotation.
Java
```
@SpringJUnitConfig
(TestConfig
.
class
)
class
BeanOverrideTests
{
@MockitoSpyBean
(
1
)
CustomService customService;
// tests...
}
Copied!
```

Wrap the bean with type
CustomService
with a Mockito spy.
In the example above, we are wrapping the bean with type
CustomService
. If more than
one bean of that type exists, the bean named
customService
is considered. Otherwise,
the test will fail, and you will need to provide a qualifier of some sort to identify
which of the
CustomService
beans you want to spy.
The following example uses a by-name lookup, rather than a by-type lookup.
Java
```
@SpringJUnitConfig
(TestConfig
.
class
)
class
BeanOverrideTests
{
@MockitoSpyBean
(
"service"
)
(
1
)
CustomService customService;
// tests...
}
Copied!
```
1
Wrap the bean named
service
with a Mockito spy.
The following
@SharedSpies
annotation registers two spies by-type and one spy by-name.
Java
```
@Target
(ElementType.TYPE)
@Retention
(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@MockitoSpyBean
(types = {OrderService
.
class
,
UserService
.
class
})
(1)
@
MockitoSpyBean
(
name
=
"ps1"
, types = PrintingService
.
class
)
(2)
public
@
interface
SharedSpies
{
}
Copied!
```
1
Register
OrderService
and
UserService
spies by-type.
2
Register
PrintingService
spy by-name.
The following demonstrates how
@SharedSpies
can be used on a test class.
Java
```
@SpringJUnitConfig
(TestConfig
.
class
)
@
SharedSpies
(1)
class
BeanOverrideTests
{
@Autowired
OrderService orderService;
(
2
)
@Autowired
UserService userService;
(
2
)
@Autowired
PrintingService ps1;
(
2
)
// Inject other components that rely on the spies.
@Test
void
testThatDependsOnMocks
()
{
// ...
}
}
Copied!
```
1
Register common spies via the custom
@SharedSpies
annotation.
2
Optionally inject spies to
stub
or
verify
them.
The spies can also be injected into
@Configuration
classes or other test-related
components in the
ApplicationContext
in order to configure them with Mockito’s stubbing
APIs.
