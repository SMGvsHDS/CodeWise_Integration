@RecordApplicationEvents
@RecordApplicationEvents
is an annotation that can be applied to a test class to
instruct the
Spring TestContext Framework
to record all application events that are
published in the
ApplicationContext
during the execution of a single test.
The recorded events can be accessed via the
ApplicationEvents
API within tests.
See
Application Events
and the
