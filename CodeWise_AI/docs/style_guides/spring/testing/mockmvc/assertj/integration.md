MockMvc integration
If you want to use the AssertJ support but have invested in the original
MockMvc
API,
MockMvcTester
offers several ways to integrate with it.
If you have your own
RequestBuilder
implementation, you can trigger the processing
of the request using
perform
. The example below showcases how the query can be
crafted with the original API:
```
// Static import on MockMvcRequestBuilders.get
assertThat(mockMvc.perform(get(
"/hotels/{id}"
,
42
)))
.hasStatusOk();
Copied!
```
Similarly, if you have crafted custom matchers that you use with the
.andExpect
feature
of
MockMvc
you can use them via
.matches
. In the example below, we rewrite the
preceding example to assert the status with  the
ResultMatcher
implementation that
MockMvc
provides:
```
// Static import on MockMvcResultMatchers.status
assertThat(mockMvc.get().uri(
"/hotels/{id}"
,
42
))
.matches(status().isOk());
Copied!
```
MockMvc
also defines a
ResultHandler
contract that lets you execute arbitrary actions
on
MvcResult
. If you have implemented this contract you can invoke it using
.apply
.
