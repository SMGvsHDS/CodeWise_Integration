Filter Registrations
When setting up a
MockMvc
instance, you can register one or more Servlet
Filter
instances, as the following example shows:
Java
Kotlin
```
mockMvc = standaloneSetup(
new
PersonController()).addFilters(
new
CharacterEncodingFilter()).build();
Copied!
```
```
// Not possible in Kotlin until {kotlin-issues}/KT-22208 is fixed
Copied!
```
Registered filters are invoked through the
MockFilterChain
from
spring-test
, and the
last filter delegates to the
DispatcherServlet
.
