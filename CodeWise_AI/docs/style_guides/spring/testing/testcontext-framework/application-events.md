Application Events
The TestContext framework provides support for recording
application events
published in the
ApplicationContext
so that assertions can be performed against those
events within tests. All events published during the execution of a single test are made
available via the
ApplicationEvents
API which allows you to process the events as a
java.util.Stream
.
To use
ApplicationEvents
in your tests, do the following.
Ensure that your test class is annotated or meta-annotated with
@RecordApplicationEvents
.
Ensure that the
ApplicationEventsTestExecutionListener
is registered. Note, however,
that
ApplicationEventsTestExecutionListener
is registered by default and only needs
to be manually registered if you have custom configuration via
@TestExecutionListeners
that does not include the default listeners.
When using the
SpringExtension for JUnit Jupiter
,
declare a method parameter of type
ApplicationEvents
in a
@Test
,
@BeforeEach
, or
@AfterEach
method.
Since
ApplicationEvents
is scoped to the lifecycle of the current test method, this
is the recommended approach.
Alternatively, you can annotate a field of type
ApplicationEvents
with
@Autowired
and use that instance of
ApplicationEvents
in your test and lifecycle methods.
ApplicationEvents
is registered with the
ApplicationContext
as a
resolvable
dependency
which is scoped to the lifecycle of the current test method. Consequently,
ApplicationEvents
cannot be accessed outside the lifecycle of a test method and cannot be
@Autowired
into the constructor of a test class.
The following test class uses the
SpringExtension
for JUnit Jupiter and
AssertJ
to assert the types of application events published while
invoking a method in a Spring-managed component:
Java
Kotlin
```
@SpringJUnitConfig
(
/* ... */
)
@RecordApplicationEvents
(
1
)
class
OrderServiceTests
{
@Test
void
submitOrder
(@Autowired OrderService service, ApplicationEvents events)
{
(
2
)
// Invoke method in OrderService that publishes an event
service.submitOrder(
new
Order(
/* ... */
));
// Verify that an OrderSubmitted event was published
long
numEvents = events.stream(OrderSubmitted
.
class
).
count
()
;
(
3
)
assertThat(numEvents).isEqualTo(
1
);
}
}
Copied!
```
1
Annotate the test class with
@RecordApplicationEvents
.
2
Inject the
ApplicationEvents
instance for the current test.
3
Use the
ApplicationEvents
API to count how many
OrderSubmitted
events were published.
```
@SpringJUnitConfig(/* ... */)
@RecordApplicationEvents
(
1
)
class
OrderServiceTests
{
@Test
fun
submitOrder
(
@Autowired
service:
OrderService
, events:
ApplicationEvents
)
{
(
2
)
// Invoke method in OrderService that publishes an event
service.submitOrder(Order(
/* ... */
))
// Verify that an OrderSubmitted event was published
val
numEvents = events.stream(OrderSubmitted::
class
).
count
()
(
3
)
assertThat(numEvents).isEqualTo(
1
)
}
}
Copied!
```
