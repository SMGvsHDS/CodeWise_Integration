# Google Java Style Guide


## 1 Introduction


This document serves as thecompletedefinition of Google's coding standards for
source code in the Java™ Programming Language. A Java source file is described as beingin
Google Styleif and only if it adheres to the rules herein.


Like other programming style guides, the issues covered span not only aesthetic issues of
formatting, but other types of conventions or coding standards as well. However, this document
focuses primarily on thehard-and-fast rulesthat we follow universally, and
avoids givingadvicethat isn't clearly enforceable (whether by human or tool).


### 1.1 Terminology notes


In this document, unless otherwise clarified:

- The termclassis used inclusively to mean a normal class, record class, enum
  class, interface or annotation type (@interface).
- The termmember(of a class) is used inclusively to mean a nested class, field,
  method,or constructor; that is, all top-level contents of a class except initializers.
- The termcommentalways refers toimplementationcomments. We do not
  use the phrase "documentation comments", and instead use the common term "Javadoc."

Other "terminology notes" will appear occasionally throughout the document.


### 1.2 Guide notes


Example code in this document isnon-normative. That is, while the examples
are in Google Style, they may not illustrate theonlystylish way to represent the
code. Optional formatting choices made in examples should not be enforced as rules.


## 2 Source file basics


### 2.1 File name


For a source file containing classes, the file name consists of the case-sensitive name of the
top-level class (of which there isexactly one), plus the.javaextension.


### 2.2 File encoding: UTF-8


Source files are encoded inUTF-8.


### 2.3 Special characters


#### 2.3.1 Whitespace characters


Aside from the line terminator sequence, theASCII horizontal space
character(0x20) is the only whitespace character that appears
anywhere in a source file. This implies that:

- All other whitespace characters are escaped incharand string literals and in
    text blocks.
- Tab characters arenotused for indentation.

#### 2.3.2 Special escape sequences


For any character that has aspecial escape sequence(\b,\t,\n,\f,\r,\s,\",\'and\\), that sequence
is used rather than the corresponding octal
(e.g.\012) or Unicode
(e.g.\u000a) escape.


#### 2.3.3 Non-ASCII characters


For the remaining non-ASCII characters, either the actual Unicode character
(e.g.∞) or the equivalent Unicode escape
(e.g.\u221e) is used. The choice depends only on
which makes the codeeasier to read and understand, although Unicode escapes
outside string literals and comments are strongly discouraged.


Tip:In the Unicode escape case, and occasionally even when actual
Unicode characters are used, an explanatory comment can be very helpful.


Examples:


Tip:Never make your code less readable simply out of fear that
some programs might not handle non-ASCII characters properly. If that should happen, those
programs arebrokenand they must befixed.


## 3 Source file structure


An ordinary source file consists of these sections,in order:

- License or copyright information, if present
- Package declaration
- Imports
- Exactly one top-level class declaration

Exactly one blank lineseparates each section that is present.


Apackage-info.javafile is the same, but without the class declaration.


Amodule-info.javafile does not contain a package declaration and replaces the
class declaration with a module declaration, but otherwise follows the same structure.


### 3.1 License or copyright information, if present


If license or copyright information belongs in a file, it belongs here.


### 3.2 Package declaration


The package declaration isnot line-wrapped. The column limit (Section 4.4,Column limit: 100) does not apply to package declarations.


### 3.3 Imports


#### 3.3.1 No wildcard imports


Wildcard ("on-demand") imports, static or otherwise,are not
  used.


#### 3.3.2 No line-wrapping


Imports arenot line-wrapped. The column limit (Section 4.4,Column limit: 100) does not apply to imports.


#### 3.3.3 Ordering and spacing


Imports are ordered as follows:

- All static imports in a single group.
- All non-static imports in a single group.

If there are both static and non-static imports, a single blank line separates the two
groups. There are no other blank lines between imports.


Within each group the imported names appear in ASCII sort order. (Note:this is not the same as the importlinesbeing in ASCII sort order, since '.'
sorts before ';'.)


#### 3.3.4 No static import for classes


Static import is not used for static nested classes. They are imported with
normal imports.


### 3.4 Class declaration


#### 3.4.1 Exactly one top-level class declaration


Each top-level class resides in a source file of its own.


#### 3.4.2 Ordering of class contents


The order you choose for the members and initializers of your class can have a great effect on
learnability. However, there's no single correct recipe for how to do it; different classes may
order their contents in different ways.


What is important is that each class usessomelogical order, which its
maintainer could explain if asked. For example, new methods are not just habitually added to the end
of the class, as that would yield "chronological by date added" ordering, which is not a logical
ordering.


Methods of a class that share the same name appear in a single contiguous group with no other
  members in between. The same applies to multiple constructors. This rule applies even when
  modifiers such asstaticorprivatediffer between the methods or constructors.


### 3.5 Module declaration


#### 3.5.1 Ordering and spacing of module directives


Module directives are ordered as follows:

- Allrequiresdirectives in a single block.
- Allexportsdirectives in a single block.
- Allopensdirectives in a single block.
- Allusesdirectives in a single block.
- Allprovidesdirectives in a single block.

A single blank line separates each block that is present.


## 4 Formatting


Terminology Note:block-like constructrefers to
the body of a class, method, constructor, or switch. Note that, by Section 4.8.3.1 onarray initializers, any array initializermayoptionally be treated as if it were a block-like construct.


### 4.1 Braces


#### 4.1.1 Use of optional braces


Braces are used withif,else,for,doandwhilestatements, even when the
body is empty or contains only a single statement.


Other optional braces, such as those in a lambda expression, remain optional.


#### 4.1.2 Nonempty blocks: K & R style


Braces follow the Kernighan and Ritchie style fornonemptyblocks and block-like
  constructs:

- No line break before the opening brace, except as detailed below.
- Line break after the opening brace.
- Line break before the closing brace.
- Line break after the closing brace,only ifthat brace terminates a statement or
  terminates the body of a method, constructor, ornamedclass.
  For example, there isnoline break after the brace if it is followed byelseor a comma.

Exception: In places where these rules allow a single statement ending with a semicolon
(;), a block of statements can appear, and the opening
brace of this block is preceded by a line break. Blocks like these are typically introduced to
limit the scope of local variables.


Examples:


```java
return () -> {
  while (condition()) {
    method();
  }
};

return new MyClass() {
  @Override public void method() {
    if (condition()) {
      try {
        something();
      } catch (ProblemException e) {
        recover();
      }
    } else if (otherCondition()) {
      somethingElse();
    } else {
      lastThing();
    }
    {
      int x = foo();
      frob(x);
    }
  }
};
```


A few exceptions for enum classes are given in Section 4.8.1,Enum classes.


#### 4.1.3 Empty blocks: may be concise


An empty block or block-like construct may be in K & R style (as described inSection 4.1.2). Alternatively, it may be closed immediately
after it is opened, with no characters or line break in between
({}),unlessit is part of amulti-block statement(one that directly contains multiple blocks:if/elseortry/catch/finally).


Examples:


```java
// This is acceptable
  void doNothing() {}

  // This is equally acceptable
  void doNothingElse() {
  }
```


```java
// This is not acceptable: No concise empty blocks in a multi-block statement
  try {
    doSomething();
  } catch (Exception e) {}
```


### 4.2 Block indentation: +2 spaces


Each time a new block or block-like construct is opened, the indent increases by two
spaces. When the block ends, the indent returns to the previous indent level. The indent level
applies to both code and comments throughout the block. (See the example in Section 4.1.2,Nonempty blocks: K & R Style.)


### 4.3 One statement per line


Each statement is followed by a line break.


### 4.4 Column limit: 100


Java code has a column limit of 100 characters. A "character" means any Unicode code point.
Except as noted below, any line that would exceed this limit must be line-wrapped, as explained in
Section 4.5,Line-wrapping.


Each Unicode code point counts as one character, even if its display width is
greater or less. For example, if usingfullwidth characters,
you may choose to wrap the line earlier than where this rule strictly requires.


Exceptions:

- Lines where obeying the column limit is not possible (for example, a long URL in Javadoc,
  or a long JSNI method reference).
- packagedeclarations and
  imports (see Sections 3.2Package declarationsand
  3.3Imports).
- Contents oftext blocks.
- Command lines in a comment that may be copied-and-pasted into a shell.
- Very long identifiers, on the rare occasions they are called for, are allowed to exceed the
  column limit. In that case, the valid wrapping for the surrounding code is as produced bygoogle-java-format.

### 4.5 Line-wrapping


Terminology Note:When code that might otherwise
occupy a single line is divided into multiple lines, this activity is calledline-wrapping.


There is no comprehensive, deterministic formula showingexactlyhow to line-wrap in
every situation. Very often there are several valid ways to line-wrap the same piece of code.


Note:While the typical reason for line-wrapping is to avoid
overflowing the column limit, even code that would in fact fit within the column limitmaybe line-wrapped at the author's discretion.


Tip:Extracting a method or local variable may solve the problem
without the need to line-wrap.


#### 4.5.1 Where to break


The prime directive of line-wrapping is: prefer to break at ahigher syntactic level. Also:

- When a line is broken at anon-assignmentoperator the break comesbeforethe symbol. (Note that this is not the same practice used in Google style for other languages,
  such as C++ and JavaScript.)This also applies to the following "operator-like" symbols:the dot separator (.)the two colons of a method reference
          (::)an ampersand in a type bound
          (<T extends Foo & Bar>)a pipe in a catch block
          (catch (FooException | BarException e)).
- This also applies to the following "operator-like" symbols:the dot separator (.)the two colons of a method reference
          (::)an ampersand in a type bound
          (<T extends Foo & Bar>)a pipe in a catch block
          (catch (FooException | BarException e)).
- the dot separator (.)
- the two colons of a method reference
          (::)
- an ampersand in a type bound
          (<T extends Foo & Bar>)
- a pipe in a catch block
          (catch (FooException | BarException e)).
- When a line is broken at anassignmentoperator the break typically comesafterthe symbol, but either way is acceptable.This also applies to the colon in an enhancedfor("foreach") statement.
- This also applies to the colon in an enhancedfor("foreach") statement.
- A method, constructor, or record-class name stays attached to the open parenthesis
  (() that follows it.
- A comma (,) stays attached to the token that
  precedes it.
- A line is never broken adjacent to the arrow in a lambda or a switch rule, except that a
  break may come immediately after the arrow if the text following it consists of a single unbraced
  expression. Examples:MyLambda<String, Long, Object> lambda =
    (String label, Long value, Object obj) -> {
      ...
    };

Predicate<String> predicate = str ->
    longExpressionInvolving(str);

switch (x) {
  case ColorPoint(Color color, Point(int x, int y)) ->
      handleColorPoint(color, x, y);
  ...
}
- This also applies to the following "operator-like" symbols:the dot separator (.)the two colons of a method reference
          (::)an ampersand in a type bound
          (<T extends Foo & Bar>)a pipe in a catch block
          (catch (FooException | BarException e)).
- the dot separator (.)
- the two colons of a method reference
          (::)
- an ampersand in a type bound
          (<T extends Foo & Bar>)
- a pipe in a catch block
          (catch (FooException | BarException e)).
- the dot separator (.)
- the two colons of a method reference
          (::)
- an ampersand in a type bound
          (<T extends Foo & Bar>)
- a pipe in a catch block
          (catch (FooException | BarException e)).
- This also applies to the colon in an enhancedfor("foreach") statement.

```java
MyLambda<String, Long, Object> lambda =
    (String label, Long value, Object obj) -> {
      ...
    };

Predicate<String> predicate = str ->
    longExpressionInvolving(str);

switch (x) {
  case ColorPoint(Color color, Point(int x, int y)) ->
      handleColorPoint(color, x, y);
  ...
}
```


Note:The primary goal for line wrapping is to have clear
code,not necessarilycode that fits in the smallest number of lines.


#### 4.5.2 Indent continuation lines at least +4 spaces


When line-wrapping, each line after the first (eachcontinuation line) is indented
at least +4 from the original line.


When there are multiple continuation lines, indentation may be varied beyond +4 as
desired. In general, two continuation lines use the same indentation level if and only if they
begin with syntactically parallel elements.


Section 4.6.3 onHorizontal alignmentaddresses
the discouraged practice of using a variable number of spaces to align certain tokens with
previous lines.


### 4.6 Whitespace


#### 4.6.1 Vertical whitespace (blank lines)


A single blank line always appears:

- Betweenconsecutive members or initializers of a class: fields, constructors,
  methods, nested classes, static initializers, and instance initializers.Exception:A blank line between two consecutive
    fields (having no other code between them) is optional. Such blank lines are used as needed to
    createlogical groupingsof fields.Exception:Blank lines between enum constants are
    covered inSection 4.8.1.
- Exception:A blank line between two consecutive
    fields (having no other code between them) is optional. Such blank lines are used as needed to
    createlogical groupingsof fields.
- Exception:Blank lines between enum constants are
    covered inSection 4.8.1.
- As required by other sections of this document (such as Section 3,Source file structure, and Section 3.3,Imports).
- Exception:A blank line between two consecutive
    fields (having no other code between them) is optional. Such blank lines are used as needed to
    createlogical groupingsof fields.
- Exception:Blank lines between enum constants are
    covered inSection 4.8.1.

A single blank line may also appear anywhere it improves readability, for example between
statements to organize the code into logical subsections. A blank line before the first member or
initializer, or after the last member or initializer of the class, is neither encouraged nor
discouraged.


Multipleconsecutive blank lines are permitted, but never required (or encouraged).


#### 4.6.2 Horizontal whitespace


Beyond where required by the language or other style rules, and apart from within literals,
comments and Javadoc, a single ASCII space also appears in the following placesonly.

- Separating any keyword, such asif,fororcatch, from an open parenthesis
  (()
  that follows it on that line
- Separating any keyword, such aselseorcatch, from a closing curly brace
  (}) that precedes it on that line
- Before any open curly brace
  ({), with two exceptions:@SomeAnnotation({a, b})(no space is used)String[][] x = {{"foo"}};(no space is required
    between{{, by item 10 below)
- @SomeAnnotation({a, b})(no space is used)
- String[][] x = {{"foo"}};(no space is required
    between{{, by item 10 below)
- On both sides of any binary or ternary operator. This also applies to the following
  "operator-like" symbols:the ampersand that separates multiple type bounds:<T extends Foo & Bar>the pipe for a catch block that handles multiple exceptions:catch (FooException | BarException e)the colon (:) in an enhancedfor("foreach") statementthe arrow in a lambda expression:(String str) -> str.length()or switch rule:case "FOO" -> bar();but notthe two colons (::) of a method reference, which
    is written likeObject::toStringthe dot separator (.), which is written likeobject.toString()
- the ampersand that separates multiple type bounds:<T extends Foo & Bar>
- the pipe for a catch block that handles multiple exceptions:catch (FooException | BarException e)
- the colon (:) in an enhancedfor("foreach") statement
- the arrow in a lambda expression:(String str) -> str.length()or switch rule:case "FOO" -> bar();
- the two colons (::) of a method reference, which
    is written likeObject::toString
- the dot separator (.), which is written likeobject.toString()
- After,:;or the closing parenthesis
  ()) of a cast
- Between any content and a double slash (//) which
  begins a comment. Multiple spaces are allowed.
- Between a double slash (//) which begins a comment
  and the comment's text. Multiple spaces are allowed.
- Between the type and identifier of a declaration:List<String> list
- Optionaljust inside both braces of an array initializernew int[] {5, 6}andnew int[] { 5, 6 }are both valid
- new int[] {5, 6}andnew int[] { 5, 6 }are both valid
- Between a type annotation and[]or....
- @SomeAnnotation({a, b})(no space is used)
- String[][] x = {{"foo"}};(no space is required
    between{{, by item 10 below)
- the ampersand that separates multiple type bounds:<T extends Foo & Bar>
- the pipe for a catch block that handles multiple exceptions:catch (FooException | BarException e)
- the colon (:) in an enhancedfor("foreach") statement
- the arrow in a lambda expression:(String str) -> str.length()or switch rule:case "FOO" -> bar();
- the two colons (::) of a method reference, which
    is written likeObject::toString
- the dot separator (.), which is written likeobject.toString()
- new int[] {5, 6}andnew int[] { 5, 6 }are both valid

This rule is never interpreted as requiring or forbidding additional space at the start or
end of a line; it addresses onlyinteriorspace.


#### 4.6.3 Horizontal alignment: never required


Terminology Note:Horizontal alignmentis the
practice of adding a variable number of additional spaces in your code with the goal of making
certain tokens appear directly below certain other tokens on previous lines.


This practice is permitted, but isnever requiredby Google Style. It is not
even required tomaintainhorizontal alignment in places where it was already used.


Here is an example without alignment, then using alignment:


```java
private int x; // this is fine
private Color color; // this too

private int   x;      // permitted, but future edits
private Color color;  // may leave it unaligned
```


Tip:Alignment can aid readability, but attempting to preserve
alignment for its own sake creates future problems. For example, consider a change that touches only
one line. If that change disrupts the previous alignment, it's important **not** to introduce
additional changes on nearby lines simply to realign them. Introducing formatting changes on
otherwise unaffected lines corrupts version history, slows down reviewers, and exacerbates merge
conflicts. These practical concerns take priority over alignment.


### 4.7 Grouping parentheses: recommended


Optional grouping parentheses are omitted only when author and reviewer agree that there is no
reasonable chance the code will be misinterpreted without them, nor would they have made the code
easier to read. It isnotreasonable to assume that every reader has the entire Java
operator precedence table memorized.


### 4.8 Specific constructs


#### 4.8.1 Enum classes


After the comma that follows an enum constant, a line break is optional. Additional blank
lines (usually just one) are also allowed. This is one possibility:


```java
private enum Answer {
  YES {
    @Override public String toString() {
      return "yes";
    }
  },

  NO,
  MAYBE
}
```


An enum class with no methods and no documentation on its constants may optionally be formatted
as if it were an array initializer (see Section 4.8.3.1 onarray initializers).


```java
private enum Suit { CLUBS, HEARTS, SPADES, DIAMONDS }
```


Since enum classesare classes, all other rules for formatting classes apply.


#### 4.8.2 Variable declarations


Every variable declaration (field or local) declares only one variable: declarations such asint a, b;are not used.


Exception:Multiple variable declarations are acceptable in the header of aforloop.


Local variables arenothabitually declared at the start of their containing
block or block-like construct. Instead, local variables are declared close to the point they are
first used (within reason), to minimize their scope. Local variable declarations typically have
initializers, or are initialized immediately after declaration.


#### 4.8.3 Arrays


Any array initializer mayoptionallybe formatted as if it were a "block-like
construct." For example, the following are all valid (notan exhaustive
list):


```java
new int[] {           new int[] {
  0, 1, 2, 3            0,
}                       1,
                        2,
new int[] {             3,
  0, 1,               }
  2, 3
}                     new int[]
                          {0, 1, 2, 3}
```


The square brackets form a part of thetype, not the variable:String[] args, notString args[].


#### 4.8.4 Switch statements and expressions


For historical reasons, the Java language has two distinct syntaxes forswitch, which we can callold-styleandnew-style. New-style switches use an arrow
(->) after the switch labels, while old-style switches
use a colon (:).


Terminology Note:Inside the braces of aswitch blockare either one or moreswitch rules(new-style);
or one or morestatement groups(old-style). Aswitch
ruleconsists of aswitch label(case ...ordefault) followed by->and an expression, block, orthrow. A statement group consists of one or more switch labels each followed by
a colon, then one or more statements, or, for thelaststatement group,zeroor
more statements. (These definitions match the Java Language Specification,§14.11.)


As with any other block, the contents of a switch block are indented +2. Each switch label
starts with this +2 indentation.


In a new-style switch, a switch rule can be written on a single line if it otherwise follows
Google style. (It must not exceed the column limit, and if it contains a non-empty block then
there must be a line break after{.) The line-wrapping
rules ofSection 4.5apply, including the +4 indent for
continuation lines. For a switch rule with a non-empty block after the arrow, the same rules apply
as for blocks elsewhere: lines between{and}are indented a further +2 relative to the line with the
switch label.


```java
switch (number) {
  case 0, 1 -> handleZeroOrOne();
  case 2 ->
      handleTwoWithAnExtremelyLongMethodCallThatWouldNotFitOnTheSameLine();
  default -> {
    logger.atInfo().log("Surprising number %s", number);
    handleSurprisingNumber(number);
  }
}
```


In an old-style switch, the colon of each switch label is followed by a line break. The
statements within a statement group are indented a further +2.


Within an old-style switch block, each statement group either terminates abruptly (with abreak,continue,returnor thrown exception), or is marked with a comment
to indicate that execution will ormightcontinue into the next statement group. Any
comment that communicates the idea of fall-through is sufficient (typically// fall through). This special comment is not required in
the last statement group of the switch block. Example:


```java
switch (input) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
    prepareOneOrTwo();
  // fall through
  case 3:
    handleOneTwoOrThree();
    break;
  default:
    handleLargeNumber(input);
}
```


Notice that no comment is needed aftercase 1:, only
at the end of the statement group.


There is no fall-through in new-style switches.


The Java language requires switch expressions and many kinds of switch statements to beexhaustive. That effectively means that every possible value that could be switched on will
be matched by one of the switch labels. A switch is exhaustive if it has adefaultlabel, but also for example if the value being switched
on is an enum and every value of the enum is matched by a switch label. Google Style requireseveryswitch to be exhaustive, even those where the language itself does not require it.
This may require adding adefaultlabel, even if it
contains no code.


Switch expressions must be new-style switches:


```java
return switch (list.size()) {
    case 0 -> "";
    case 1 -> list.getFirst();
    default -> String.join(", ", list);
  };
```


#### 4.8.5 Annotations


Type-use annotations appear immediately before the annotated type. An annotation is a type-use
annotation if it is meta-annotated with@Target(ElementType.TYPE_USE). Example:


```java
final @Nullable String name;

public @Nullable Person getPersonByName(String name);
```


Annotations applying to a class, package, or module declaration appear immediately after the
documentation block, and each annotation is listed on a line of its own (that is, one annotation
per line). These line breaks do not constitute line-wrapping (Section
4.5,Line-wrapping), so the indentation level is not
increased. Examples:


```java
/** This is a class. */
@Deprecated
@CheckReturnValue
public final class Frozzler { ... }
```


```java
/** This is a package. */
@Deprecated
@CheckReturnValue
package com.example.frozzler;
```


```java
/** This is a module. */
@Deprecated
@SuppressWarnings("CheckReturnValue")
module com.example.frozzler { ... }
```


The rules for annotations on method and constructor declarations are the same as theprevious section. Example:


```java
@Deprecated
@Override
public String getNameIfPresent() { ... }
```


Exception:Asingleparameterless annotationmayinstead appear together with the first line of the signature, for example:


```java
@Override public int hashCode() { ... }
```


Annotations applying to a field also appear immediately after the documentation block, but in
this case,multipleannotations (possibly parameterized) may be listed on the same line;
for example:


```java
@Partial @Mock DataLoader loader;
```


There are no specific rules for formatting annotations on parameters or local variables (except,
of course, when the annotation is a type-use annotation).


#### 4.8.6 Comments


This section addressesimplementation comments. Javadoc is addressed separately in
Section 7,Javadoc.


Any line break may be preceded by arbitrary whitespace followed by an implementation comment.
Such a comment renders the line non-blank.


Block comments are indented at the same level as the surrounding code. They may be in/* ... */style or// ...style. For multi-line/* ... */comments, subsequent lines must start with*aligned with the*on the previous line.


```java
/*
 * This is          // And so           /* Or you can
 * okay.            // is this.          * even do this. */
 */
```


Comments are not enclosed in boxes drawn with asterisks or other characters.


Tip:When writing multi-line comments, use the/* ... */style if you want automatic code formatters to
re-wrap the lines when necessary (paragraph-style). Most formatters don't re-wrap lines in// ...style comment blocks.


UseTODOcomments for code that is temporary, a short-term solution, or good-enough
  but not perfect.


ATODOcomment begins with the wordTODOin all caps, a following
  colon, and a link to a resource that contains the context, ideally a bug reference. A bug
  reference is preferable because bugs are tracked and have follow-up comments. Follow this piece of
  context with an explanatory string introduced with a hyphen-.


The purpose is to have a consistentTODOformat that can be searched to find out how
  to get more details.


```
// TODO: crbug.com/12345678 - Remove this after the 2047q4 compatibility window expires.
```


Avoid adding TODOs that refer to an individual or team as the context:


```
// TODO: @yourusername - File an issue and use a '*' for repetition.
```


If yourTODOis of the form "At a future date do something" make sure that you
  either include a very specific date ("Fix by November 2005") or a very specific event ("Remove
  this code when all clients can handle XML responses.").


#### 4.8.7 Modifiers


Class and member modifiers, when present, appear in the order
recommended by the Java Language Specification:


```
public protected private abstract default static final sealed non-sealed
  transient volatile synchronized native strictfp
```


Modifiers onrequiresmodule directives, when present, appear in the following
order:


```
transitive static
```


#### 4.8.8 Numeric Literals


long-valued integer literals use an uppercaseLsuffix, never
lowercase (to avoid confusion with the digit1). For example,3000000000Lrather than3000000000l.


#### 4.8.9 Text Blocks


The opening"""of a text block is always on a new line. That line may
  either follow the same indentation rules as other constructs, or it may have no indentation at all
  (so it starts at the left margin). The closing"""is on a new line
  with the same indentation as the opening""", and may be followed on the
  same line by further code. Each line of text in the text block is indented at least as much as the
  opening and closing""". (If a line is indented further, then the string
  literal defined by the text block will have space at the start of that line.)


The contents of a text block may exceed thecolumn limit.


## 5 Naming


### 5.1 Rules common to all identifiers


Identifiers use only ASCII letters and digits, and, in a small number of cases noted below,
underscores. Thus each valid identifier name is matched by the regular expression\w+.


In Google Style, special prefixes or suffixes arenotused. For example, these
names are not Google Style:name_,mName,s_nameandkName.


### 5.2 Rules by identifier type


#### 5.2.1 Package and module names


Package and module names use only lowercase letters and digits (no underscores). Consecutive
words are simply concatenated together. For example,com.example.deepspace, notcom.example.deepSpaceorcom.example.deep_space.


#### 5.2.2 Class names


Class names are written inUpperCamelCase.


Class names are typically nouns or noun phrases. For example,CharacterorImmutableList. Interface names may also be nouns or
noun phrases (for example,List), but may sometimes be
adjectives or adjective phrases instead (for example,Readable).


There are no specific rules or even well-established conventions for naming annotation types.


Atestclass has a name that ends withTest,
for example,HashIntegrationTest.
If it covers a single class, its name is the name of that class
plusTest, for exampleHashImplTest.


#### 5.2.3 Method names


Method names are written inlowerCamelCase.


Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases. For example,sendMessageorstop.


Underscores may appear in JUnittestmethod names to separate logical components of the
name, witheachcomponent written inlowerCamelCase, for
exampletransferMoney_deductsFromSource. There is no One
Correct Way to name test methods.


#### 5.2.4 Constant names


Constant names useUPPER_SNAKE_CASE: all uppercase
letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore. But whatisa
constant, exactly?


Constants are static final fields whose contents are deeply immutable and whose methods have no
detectable side effects. Examples include primitives, strings, immutable value classes, and anything
set tonull. If any of the instance's observable state can change, it is not a
constant. Merelyintendingto never mutate the object is not enough. Examples:


```java
// Constants
static final int NUMBER = 5;
static final ImmutableList<String> NAMES = ImmutableList.of("Ed", "Ann");
static final Map<String, Integer> AGES = ImmutableMap.of("Ed", 35, "Ann", 32);
static final Joiner COMMA_JOINER = Joiner.on(','); // because Joiner is immutable
static final SomeMutableType[] EMPTY_ARRAY = {};

// Not constants
static String nonFinal = "non-final";
final String nonStatic = "non-static";
static final Set<String> mutableCollection = new HashSet<String>();
static final ImmutableSet<SomeMutableType> mutableElements = ImmutableSet.of(mutable);
static final ImmutableMap<String, SomeMutableType> mutableValues =
    ImmutableMap.of("Ed", mutableInstance, "Ann", mutableInstance2);
static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.getName());
static final String[] nonEmptyArray = {"these", "can", "change"};
```


These names are typically nouns or noun phrases.


#### 5.2.5 Non-constant field names


Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written
inlowerCamelCase.


These names are typically nouns or noun phrases.  For example,computedValuesorindex.


#### 5.2.6 Parameter names


Parameter names are written inlowerCamelCase.


One-character parameter names in public methods should be avoided.


#### 5.2.7 Local variable names


Local variable names are written inlowerCamelCase.


Even when final and immutable, local variables are not considered to be constants, and should not
be styled as constants.


#### 5.2.8 Type variable names


Each type variable is named in one of two styles:

- A single capital letter, optionally followed by a single numeral (such asE,T,X,T2)
- A name in the form used for classes (see Section 5.2.2,Class names), followed by the capital letterT(examples:RequestT,FooBarT).

### 5.3 Camel case: defined


Sometimes there is more than one reasonable way to convert an English phrase into camel case,
such as when acronyms or unusual constructs like "IPv6" or "iOS" are present. To improve
predictability, Google Style specifies the following (nearly) deterministic scheme.


Beginning with the prose form of the name:

- Convert the phrase to plain ASCII and remove any apostrophes. For example, "Müller's
  algorithm" might become "Muellers algorithm".
- Divide this result into words, splitting on spaces and any remaining punctuation (typically
  hyphens).Recommended:if any word already has a conventional camel-case appearance in common
    usage, split this into its constituent parts (e.g., "AdWords" becomes "ad words"). Note
    that a word such as "iOS" is not really in camel caseper se; it defiesanyconvention, so this recommendation does not apply.
- Recommended:if any word already has a conventional camel-case appearance in common
    usage, split this into its constituent parts (e.g., "AdWords" becomes "ad words"). Note
    that a word such as "iOS" is not really in camel caseper se; it defiesanyconvention, so this recommendation does not apply.
- Now lowercaseeverything(including acronyms), then uppercase only the first
  character of:... each word, to yieldupper camel case, or... each word except the first, to yieldlower camel case
- ... each word, to yieldupper camel case, or
- ... each word except the first, to yieldlower camel case
- Finally, join all the words into a single identifier. Note that the casing of the original
  words is almost entirely disregarded.
- Recommended:if any word already has a conventional camel-case appearance in common
    usage, split this into its constituent parts (e.g., "AdWords" becomes "ad words"). Note
    that a word such as "iOS" is not really in camel caseper se; it defiesanyconvention, so this recommendation does not apply.
- ... each word, to yieldupper camel case, or
- ... each word except the first, to yieldlower camel case

In very rare circumstances (for example, multipart version numbers), you may need to use
underscores to separate adjacent numbers, since numbers do not have upper and lower case variants.


Examples:


*Acceptable, but not recommended.


Note:Some words are ambiguously hyphenated in the English
language: for example "nonempty" and "non-empty" are both correct, so the method namescheckNonemptyandcheckNonEmptyare likewise both correct.


## 6 Programming Practices


### 6.1@Override: always used


A method is marked with the@Overrideannotation
whenever it is legal.  This includes a class method overriding a superclass method, a class method
implementing an interface method, an interface method respecifying a superinterface method, and an
explicitly declared accessor method for a record component.


Exception:@Overridemay be omitted when the parent method is@Deprecated.


### 6.2 Caught exceptions: not ignored


It is very rarely correct to do nothing in response to a caught
exception. (Typical responses are to log it, or if it is considered "impossible", rethrow it as anAssertionError.)


When it truly is appropriate to take no action whatsoever in a catch block, the reason this is
justified is explained in a comment.


```java
try {
  int i = Integer.parseInt(response);
  return handleNumericResponse(i);
} catch (NumberFormatException ok) {
  // it's not numeric; that's fine, just continue
}
return handleTextResponse(response);
```


### 6.3 Static members: qualified using class


When a reference to a static class member must be qualified, it is qualified with that class's
name, not with a reference or expression of that class's type.


```java
Foo aFoo = ...;
Foo.aStaticMethod(); // good
aFoo.aStaticMethod(); // bad
somethingThatYieldsAFoo().aStaticMethod(); // very bad
```


### 6.4 Finalizers: not used


Do not overrideObject.finalize. Finalization support
isscheduled for removal.


## 7 Javadoc


### 7.1 Formatting


#### 7.1.1 General form


Thebasicformatting of Javadoc blocks is as seen in this example:


```java
/**
 * Multiple lines of Javadoc text are written here,
 * wrapped normally...
 */
public int method(String p1) { ... }
```


... or in this single-line example:


```java
/** An especially short bit of Javadoc. */
```


The basic form is always acceptable. The single-line form may be substituted when the entirety
of the Javadoc block (including comment markers) can fit on a single line. Note that this only
applies when there are no block tags such as@param.


#### 7.1.2 Paragraphs


One blank line—that is, a line containing only the aligned leading asterisk
(*)—appears between paragraphs, and before the group of block tags if present.
Each paragraph except the first has<p>immediately before the first word, with
no space after it. HTML tags for other block-level elements, such as<ul>or<table>, arenotpreceded with<p>.


#### 7.1.3 Block tags


Any of the standard "block tags" that are used appear in the order@param,@return,@throws,@deprecated, and these four types never
appear with an empty description. When a block tag doesn't fit on a single line, continuation lines
are indented four (or more) spaces from the position of the@.


### 7.2 The summary fragment


Each Javadoc block begins with a briefsummary fragment. This
fragment is very important: it is the only part of the text that appears in certain contexts such as
class and method indexes.


This is a fragment—a noun phrase or verb phrase, not a complete sentence. It doesnotbegin withA {@code Foo} is a..., orThis method returns..., nor does it form a complete imperative sentence
likeSave the record.. However, the fragment is capitalized and
punctuated as if it were a complete sentence.


Tip:A common mistake is to write simple Javadoc in the form/** @return the customer ID */. This is
incorrect, and should be changed to/** Returns the customer ID. */or/** {@return the customer ID} */.


### 7.3 Where Javadoc is used


At theminimum, Javadoc is present for everyvisibleclass, member, or record
component, with a few exceptions noted below. A top-level class is visible if it ispublic; a member is visible if it ispublicorprotectedand its containing
class is visible; and a record component is visible if its containing record is visible.


Additional Javadoc content may also be present, as explained in Section 7.3.4,Non-required Javadoc.


#### 7.3.1 Exception: self-explanatory members


Javadoc is optional for "simple, obvious" members and record components, such as agetFoo()method,iftherereally and
trulyis nothing else worthwhile to say but "the foo".


Important:it is not appropriate to cite this exception to justify
omitting relevant information that a typical reader might need to know. For example, for a record
component namedcanonicalName, don't omit its
documentation (with the rationale that it would say only@param canonicalName the canonical name) if a typical reader may have
no idea what the term "canonical name" means!


#### 7.3.2 Exception: overrides


Javadoc is not always present on a method that overrides a supertype method.


#### 7.3.4 Non-required Javadoc


Other classes, members, and record components have Javadocas needed or desired.


Whenever an implementation comment would be used to define the overall purpose or behavior of a
class or member, that comment is written as Javadoc instead (using/**).


Non-required Javadoc is not strictly required to follow the formatting rules of Sections
7.1.1, 7.1.2, 7.1.3, and 7.2, though it is of course recommended.
