# Google JavaScript Style Guide


Please note: This guide is no longer being updated. Google recommends migrating
to TypeScript, and following theTypeScript guide.


## 1 Introduction


This document serves as thecompletedefinition of Google’s coding standards
for source code in the JavaScript programming language. A JavaScript source file
is described as beingin Google Styleif and only if it adheres to the rules
herein.


Like other programming style guides, the issues covered span not only aesthetic
issues of formatting, but other types of conventions or coding standards as
well. However, this document focuses primarily on the hard-and-fast rules that
we follow universally, and avoids giving advice that isn't clearly enforceable
(whether by human or tool).


### 1.1 Terminology notes


In this document, unless otherwise clarified:

- The termcommentalways refers toimplementationcomments. We do not use
the phrasedocumentation comments, instead using the common term “JSDoc”
for both human-readable text and machine-readable annotations within/** …
*/.
- This Style Guide usesRFC 2119terminology when using the phrasesmust,must not,should,should not, andmay. The termspreferandavoidcorrespond toshouldandshould not, respectively. Imperative
and declarative statements are prescriptive and correspond tomust.

Otherterminology noteswill appear occasionally throughout the document.


### 1.2 Guide notes


Example code in this document isnon-normative. That is, while the examples
are in Google Style, they may not illustrate theonlystylish way to represent
the code. Optional formatting choices made in examples must not be enforced as
rules.


## 2 Source file basics


### 2.1 File name


File names must be all lowercase and may include underscores (_) or dashes
(-), but no additional punctuation. Follow the convention that your project
uses. Filenames’ extension must be.js.


### 2.2 File encoding: UTF-8


Source files are encoded inUTF-8.


### 2.3 Special characters


#### 2.3.1 Whitespace characters


Aside from the line terminator sequence, the ASCII horizontal space character
(0x20) is the only whitespace character that appears anywhere in a source file.
This implies that

- All other whitespace characters in string literals are escaped, and
- Tab characters arenotused for indentation.

All other whitespace characters in string literals are escaped, and


Tab characters arenotused for indentation.


#### 2.3.2 Special escape sequences


For any character that has a special escape sequence (\',\",\\,\b,\f,\n,\r,\t,\v), that sequence is used rather than the
corresponding numeric escape (e.g\x0a,\u000a, or\u{a}). Legacy octal
escapes are never used.


#### 2.3.3 Non-ASCII characters


For the remaining non-ASCII characters, either the actual Unicode character
(e.g.∞) or the equivalent hex or Unicode escape (e.g.\u221e) is used,
depending only on which makes the codeeasier to read and understand.


Tip: In the Unicode escape case, and occasionally even when actual Unicode
characters are used, an explanatory comment can be very helpful.


```
/* Best: perfectly clear even without a comment. */
const units = 'μs';

/* Allowed: but unnecessary as μ is a printable character. */
const units = '\u03bcs'; // 'μs'

/* Good: use escapes for non-printable characters with a comment for clarity. */
return '\ufeff' + content;  // Prepend a byte order mark.
```


```
/* Poor: the reader has no idea what character this is. */
const units = '\u03bcs';
```


Tip: Never make your code less readable simply out of fear that some programs
might not handle non-ASCII characters properly. If that happens, those programs
arebrokenand they must befixed.


## 3 Source file structure


All new source files should either be agoog.modulefile (a file containing agoog.modulecall) or an ECMAScript (ES) module (usesimportandexportstatements).


Files consist of the following,in order:

- License or copyright information, if present
- @fileoverviewJSDoc, if present
- goog.modulestatement, if agoog.modulefile
- ESimportstatements, if an ES module
- goog.requireandgoog.requireTypestatements
- The file’s implementation

Exactly one blank lineseparates each section that is present, except the
file's implementation, which may be preceded by 1 or 2 blank lines.


### 3.1 License or copyright information, if present


If license or copyright information belongs in a file, it belongs here.


### 3.2@fileoverviewJSDoc, if present


See??for formatting rules.


### 3.3goog.modulestatement


Allgoog.modulefiles must declare exactly onegoog.modulename on a single
line: lines containing agoog.moduledeclaration must not be wrapped, and are
therefore an exception to the 80-column limit.


The entire argument togoog.moduleis what defines a namespace. It is the
package name (an identifier that reflects the fragment of the directory
structure where the code lives) plus, optionally, the main class/enum/interface
that it defines concatenated to the end inlowerCamelCase.


Example:


```
goog.module('search.urlHistory.urlHistoryService');
```


#### 3.3.1 Hierarchy


Module namespaces may never be named as adirectchild of another module's
namespace.


Disallowed:


```
goog.module('foo.bar');   // 'foo.bar.qux' would be fine, though
goog.module('foo.bar.baz');
```


The directory hierarchy reflects the namespace hierarchy, so that deeper-nested
children are subdirectories of higher-level parent directories. Note that this
implies that owners of “parent” namespace groups are necessarily aware of all
child namespaces, since they exist in the same directory.


#### 3.3.2goog.module.declareLegacyNamespace


The singlegoog.modulestatement may optionally be followed by a call togoog.module.declareLegacyNamespace();. Avoidgoog.module.declareLegacyNamespace()when possible.


Example:


```
goog.module('my.test.helpers');
goog.module.declareLegacyNamespace();
goog.setTestOnly();
```


goog.module.declareLegacyNamespaceexists to ease the transition from
traditional object hierarchy-based namespaces but comes with some naming
restrictions. As the child module name must be created after the parent
namespace, this namemust notbe a child or parent of any othergoog.module(for example,goog.module('parent');andgoog.module('parent.child');cannot both exist safely, nor cangoog.module('parent');andgoog.module('parent.child.grandchild');).


#### 3.3.3goog.moduleExports


Classes, enums, functions, constants, and other symbols are exported using theexportsobject. Exported symbols may be defined directly on theexportsobject, or else declared locally and exported separately. Symbols are only
exported if they are meant to be used outside the module. Non-exported
module-local symbols are not declared@private. There is no prescribed
ordering for exported and module-local symbols.


Examples:


```
const /** !Array<number> */ exportedArray = [1, 2, 3];

const /** !Array<number> */ moduleLocalArray = [4, 5, 6];

/** @return {number} */
function moduleLocalFunction() {
  return moduleLocalArray.length;
}

/** @return {number} */
function exportedFunction() {
  return moduleLocalFunction() * 2;
}

exports = {exportedArray, exportedFunction};
```


```
/** @const {number} */
exports.CONSTANT_ONE = 1;

/** @const {string} */
exports.CONSTANT_TWO = 'Another constant';
```


Do not annotate theexportsobject as@constas it is already treated as a
constant by the compiler.


```
/** @const */
exports = {exportedFunction};
```


Do not use default exports as they don't translate easily to ES module
semantics.


```
exports = FancyClass;
```


### 3.4 ES modules


ES modules are files that use theimportandexportkeywords.


#### 3.4.1 Imports


Import statements must not be line wrapped and are therefore an exception to the
80-column limit.


ES module files must use theimportstatement to import other ES module
files. Do notgoog.requireanother ES module.


```
import './sideeffects.js';

import * as goog from '../closure/goog/goog.js';
import * as parent from '../parent.js';

import {name} from './sibling.js';
```


The.jsfile extension is not optional in import paths and must always be
included.


```
import '../directory/file';
```


```
import '../directory/file.js';
```


Do not import the same file multiple times. This can make it hard to determine
the aggregate imports of a file.


```
// Imports have the same path, but since it doesn't align it can be hard to see.
import {short} from './long/path/to/a/file.js';
import {aLongNameThatBreaksAlignment} from './long/path/to/a/file.js';
```


Module import names (import * as name) arelowerCamelCasenames that are
derived from the imported file name.


```
import * as fileOne from '../file-one.js';
import * as fileTwo from '../file_two.js';
import * as fileThree from '../filethree.js';
```


```
import * as libString from './lib/string.js';
import * as math from './math/math.js';
import * as vectorMath from './vector/math.js';
```


Some libraries might commonly use a namespace import prefix that violates this
naming scheme, but overbearingly common open source use makes the violating
style more readable. The only library that currently falls under this exception
isthreejs, using theTHREEprefix.


Default import names are derived from the imported file name and follow the
rules in??.


```
import MyClass from '../my-class.js';
import myFunction from '../my_function.js';
import SOME_CONSTANT from '../someconstant.js';
```


Note: In general this should not happen as default exports are banned by this
style guide, see??. Default imports are only used
to import modules that do not conform to this style guide.


In general symbols imported via the named import (import {name}) should keep
the same name. Avoid aliasing imports (import {SomeThing as SomeOtherThing}).
Prefer fixing name collisions by using a module import (import *) or renaming
the exports themselves.


```
import * as bigAnimals from './biganimals.js';
import * as domesticatedAnimals from './domesticatedanimals.js';

new bigAnimals.Cat();
new domesticatedAnimals.Cat();
```


If renaming a named import is needed then use components of the imported
module's file name or path in the resulting alias.


```
import {Cat as BigCat} from './biganimals.js';
import {Cat as DomesticatedCat} from './domesticatedanimals.js';

new BigCat();
new DomesticatedCat();
```


#### 3.4.2 Exports


Symbols are only exported if they are meant to be used outside the module.
Non-exported module-local symbols are not declared@private. There is no
prescribed ordering for exported and module-local symbols.


Use named exports in all code. You can apply theexportkeyword to a
declaration, or use theexport {name};syntax.


Do not use default exports. Importing modules must give a name to these values,
which can lead to inconsistencies in naming across modules.


```
// Do not use default exports:
export default class Foo { ... } // BAD!
```


```
// Use named exports:
export class Foo { ... }
```


```
// Alternate style named exports:
class Foo { ... }

export {Foo};
```


Exported variables must not be mutated outside of module initialization.


There are alternatives if mutation is needed, including exporting a constant
reference to an object that has mutable fields or exporting accessor functions for
mutable data.


```
// Bad: both foo and mutateFoo are exported and mutated.
export let /** number */ foo = 0;

/**
 * Mutates foo.
 */
export function mutateFoo() {
  ++foo;
}

/**
 * @param {function(number): number} newMutateFoo
 */
export function setMutateFoo(newMutateFoo) {
  // Exported classes and functions can be mutated!
  mutateFoo = () => {
    foo = newMutateFoo(foo);
  };
}
```


```
// Good: Rather than export the mutable variables foo and mutateFoo directly,
// instead make them module scoped and export a getter for foo and a wrapper for
// mutateFooFunc.
let /** number */ foo = 0;
let /** function(number): number */ mutateFooFunc = (foo) => foo + 1;

/** @return {number} */
export function getFoo() {
  return foo;
}

export function mutateFoo() {
  foo = mutateFooFunc(foo);
}

/** @param {function(number): number} mutateFoo */
export function setMutateFoo(mutateFoo) {
  mutateFooFunc = mutateFoo;
}
```


export fromstatements must not be line wrapped and are therefore an
exception to the 80-column limit. This applies to bothexport fromflavors.


```
export {specificName} from './other.js';
export * from './another.js';
```


#### 3.4.3 Circular Dependencies in ES modules


Do not create cycles between ES modules, even though the ECMAScript
specification allows this. Note that it is possible to create cycles with both
theimportandexportstatements.


```
// a.js
import './b.js';
```


```
// b.js
import './a.js';

// `export from` can cause circular dependencies too!
export {x} from './c.js';
```


```
// c.js
import './b.js';

export let x;
```


#### 3.4.4 Interoperating with Closure


To reference the Closuregoognamespace, import Closure'sgoog.js.


```
import * as goog from '../closure/goog/goog.js';

const {compute} = goog.require('a.name');

export const CONSTANT = compute();
```


goog.jsexports only a subset of properties from the globalgoogthat can be
used in ES modules.


goog.requirein ES modules works as it does ingoog.modulefiles. You can
require any Closure namespace symbol (i.e., symbols created bygoog.provideorgoog.module) andgoog.requirewill return the value.


```
import * as goog from '../closure/goog/goog.js';
import * as anEsModule from './anEsModule.js';

const GoogPromise = goog.require('goog.Promise');
const myNamespace = goog.require('my.namespace');
```


goog.declareModuleIdcan be used within ES modules to declare agoog.module-like module ID. This means that this module ID can begoog.required,goog.module.getd etc. as if it were
agoog.modulethat did not callgoog.module.declareLegacyNamespace. It does
not create the module ID as a globally available JavaScript symbol.


Agoog.require(orgoog.module.get) for a module ID fromgoog.declareModuleIdwill always return the module object (as if it wasimport *'d). As a result, the argument togoog.declareModuleIdshould always
end with alowerCamelCaseName.


Note: It is an error to callgoog.module.declareLegacyNamespacein an ES
module, it can only be called fromgoog.modulefiles. There is no direct way
to associate alegacynamespace with an ES module.


goog.declareModuleIdshould only be used to upgrade Closure files to ES
modules in place, where named exports are used.


```
import * as goog from '../closure/goog.js';

goog.declareModuleId('my.esm');

export class Class {};
```


### 3.5goog.setTestOnly


In agoog.modulefile thegoog.modulestatement and, if present,goog.module.declareLegacyNamespace()statement may optionally be followed by a
call togoog.setTestOnly().


In an ES module theimportstatements may optionally be
followed by a call togoog.setTestOnly().


### 3.6goog.requireandgoog.requireTypestatements


Imports are done withgoog.requireandgoog.requireTypestatements. The
names imported by agoog.requirestatement may be used both in code and in
type annotations, while those imported by agoog.requireTypemay be used in
type annotations only.


Thegoog.requireandgoog.requireTypestatements form a contiguous block
with no empty lines. This block follows thegoog.moduledeclaration separatedby a single empty line. The entire argument togoog.requireorgoog.requireTypeis a namespace defined by agoog.modulein a separate file.goog.requireandgoog.requireTypestatements may not
appear anywhere else in the file.


Eachgoog.requireorgoog.requireTypeis assigned to a single constant
alias, or else destructured into several constant aliases. These aliases are the
only acceptable way to refer to dependencies in type annotations or code. Fully
qualified namespaces must not be used anywhere, except as an argument togoog.requireorgoog.requireType.


Exception: Types, variables, and functions declared in externs files have to
use their fully qualified name in type annotations and code.


Whengoog.requireis assigned to a single constant alias, it must match the
final dot-separated component of the imported module's namespace.


Exception: In certain cases, additional components of the namespace can be
used to form a longer alias. The resulting alias must retain the original
identifier's casing such that it still correctly identifies its type. Longer
aliases may be used to disambiguate otherwise identical aliases, or if it
significantly improves readability. In addition, a longer alias must be used to
prevent masking native types such asElement,Event,Error,Map, andPromise(for a more complete list, seeStandard Built-in ObjectsandWeb APIsat MDN).


A file should not contain both agoog.requireand agoog.requireTypestatement for the same namespace. If the imported name is used both in code and
in type annotations, it should be imported by a singlegoog.requirestatement.


If a module is imported only for its side effects, the call must be agoog.require(not agoog.requireType) and assignment may be omitted. A
comment is required to explain why this is needed and suppress a compiler
warning.


The lines are sorted according to the following rules: All requires with a name
on the left hand side come first, sorted alphabetically by those names. Then
destructuring requires, again sorted by the names on the left hand side.
Finally, any require calls that are standalone (generally these are for modules
imported just for their side effects).


Tip: There’s no need to memorize this order and enforce it manually. You can
rely on your IDE to report requires
that are not sorted correctly.


If a long alias or module name would cause a line to exceed the 80-column limit,
itmust notbe wrapped: require lines are an exception to the 80-column
limit.


Example:


```
// Standard alias style.
const asserts = goog.require('goog.asserts');
// Namespace-based alias used to disambiguate.
const testingAsserts = goog.require('goog.testing.asserts');
// Standard destructuring into aliases.
const {MyClass} = goog.require('some.package');
const {MyType} = goog.requireType('other.package');
const {clear, clone} = goog.require('goog.array');
const {Rgb} = goog.require('goog.color');
// Namespace-based destructuring into aliases used to disambiguate.
const {MyClass: NsMyClass} = goog.require('other.ns');
const {SomeType: FooSomeType} = goog.requireType('foo.types');
const {clear: objectClear, clone: objectClone} = goog.require('goog.object');
// Namespace-based destructuring into aliases used to prevent masking native type.
const {Element: RendererElement} = goog.require('web.renderer');
// Out of sequence namespace-based aliases used to improve readability.
// Also, require lines longer than 80 columns must not be wrapped.
const {SomeDataStructure: SomeDataStructureModel} = goog.requireType('identical.package.identifiers.models');
const {SomeDataStructure: SomeDataStructureProto} = goog.require('proto.identical.package.identifiers');
// goog.require without an alias in order to trigger side effects.
/** @suppress {extraRequire} Initializes MyFramework. */
goog.require('my.framework.initialization');
```


Discouraged:


```
// Some legacy code uses a "default export" style to export a single class, enum,
// record type, etc. Do not use this pattern in new JS.
// When using a "default export", prefer destructuring into aliases.
const MyClass = goog.require('some.package.MyClass');
const MyType = goog.requireType('some.package.MyType');
```


```
// If necessary to disambiguate, prefer PackageClass over SomeClass as it is
// closer to the format of the module name.
const SomeClass = goog.require('some.package.Class');
```


Disallowed:


```
// Extra terms must come from the namespace.
const MyClassForBizzing = goog.require('some.package.MyClass');
// Alias must include the entire final namespace component.
const MyClass = goog.require('some.package.MyClassForBizzing');
// Alias must not mask native type (should be `const JspbMap` here).
const Map = goog.require('jspb.Map');
// Don't break goog.require lines over 80 columns.
const SomeDataStructure =
    goog.require('proto.identical.package.identifiers.SomeDataStructure');
// Alias must be based on the namespace.
const randomName = goog.require('something.else');
// Missing a space after the colon.
const {Foo:FooProto} = goog.require('some.package.proto.Foo');
// goog.requireType without an alias.
goog.requireType('some.package.with.a.Type');


/**
 * @param {!some.unimported.Dependency} param All external types used in JSDoc
 *     annotations must be goog.require'd, unless declared in externs.
 */
function someFunction(param) {
  // goog.require lines must be at the top level before any other code.
  const alias = goog.require('my.long.name.alias');
  // ...
}
```


### 3.7 The file’s implementation


The actual implementation follows after all dependency information is declared
(separated by at least one blank line).


This may consist of any module-local declarations (constants, variables,
classes, functions, etc), as well as any exported symbols.


## 4 Formatting


Terminology Note:block-like constructrefers to the body of a class,
function, method, or brace-delimited block of code. Note that, by??and??, any array or
object literal may optionally be treated as if it were a block-like construct.


Tip: Useclang-format. The JavaScript community has invested effort to make
sure clang-formatdoes the right thingon JavaScript files.clang-formathas
integration with several popular editors.


### 4.1 Braces


#### 4.1.1 Braces are used for all control structures


Braces are required for all control structures (i.e.if,else,for,do,while, as well as any others), even if the body contains only a single
statement. The first statement of a non-empty block must begin on its own line.


Disallowed:


```
if (someVeryLongCondition())
  doSomething();

for (let i = 0; i < foo.length; i++) bar(foo[i]);
```


Exception: A simple if statement that can fit entirely on a single line with
no wrapping (and that doesn’t have an else) may be kept on a single line with no
braces when it improves readability. This is the only case in which a control
structure may omit braces and newlines.


```
if (shortCondition()) foo();
```


#### 4.1.2 Nonempty blocks: K&R style


Braces follow the Kernighan and Ritchie style (Egyptian brackets) fornonemptyblocks and block-like constructs:

- No line break before the opening brace.
- Line break after the opening brace.
- Line break before the closing brace.
- Line break after the closing braceifthat brace terminates a statement or
the body of a function or class statement, or a class method. Specifically,
there isnoline break after the brace if it is followed byelse,catch,while, or a comma, semicolon, or right-parenthesis.

Example:


```
class InnerClass {
  constructor() {}

  /** @param {number} foo */
  method(foo) {
    if (condition(foo)) {
      try {
        // Note: this might fail.
        something();
      } catch (err) {
        recover();
      }
    }
  }
}
```


#### 4.1.3 Empty blocks: may be concise


An empty block or block-like constructmaybe closed immediately after it is
opened, with no characters, space, or line break in between (i.e.{}),unlessit is a part of amulti-block statement(one that directly contains
multiple blocks:if/elseortry/catch/finally).


Example:


```
function doNothing() {}
```


Disallowed:


```
if (condition) {
  // …
} else if (otherCondition) {} else {
  // …
}

try {
  // …
} catch (e) {}
```


### 4.2 Block indentation: +2 spaces


Each time a new block or block-like construct is opened, the indent increases by
two spaces. When the block ends, the indent returns to the previous indent
level. The indent level applies to both code and comments throughout the block.
(See the example in??).


#### 4.2.1 Array literals: optionallyblock-like


Any array literal may optionally be formatted as if it were a “block-like
construct.” For example, the following are all valid (notan exhaustive
list):


```
const a = [
  0,
  1,
  2,
];

const b =
    [0, 1, 2];
```


```
const c = [0, 1, 2];

someMethod(foo, [
  0, 1, 2,
], bar);
```


Other combinations are allowed, particularly when emphasizing semantic groupings
between elements, but should not be used only to reduce the vertical size of
larger arrays.


#### 4.2.2 Object literals: optionallyblock-like


Any object literal may optionally be formatted as if it were a “block-like
construct.” The same examples apply as??. For
example, the following are all valid (notan exhaustive list):


```
const a = {
  a: 0,
  b: 1,
};

const b =
    {a: 0, b: 1};
```


```
const c = {a: 0, b: 1};

someMethod(foo, {
  a: 0, b: 1,
}, bar);
```


#### 4.2.3 Class literals


Class literals (whether declarations or expressions) are indented as blocks. Do
not add semicolons after methods, or after the closing brace of a classdeclaration(statements—such as assignments—that contain classexpressionsare still terminated with a semicolon). For inheritance, theextendskeyword
is sufficient unless the superclass is templatized. Subclasses of templatized
types must explicitly specify the template type in an@extendsJSDoc
annotation, even if it is just passing along the same template name.


Example:


```
/** @template T */
class Foo {
  /** @param {T} x */
  constructor(x) {
    /** @type {T} */
    this.x = x;
  }
}

/** @extends {Foo<number>} */
class Bar extends Foo {
  constructor() {
    super(42);
  }
}

exports.Baz = class extends Bar {
  /** @return {number} */
  method() {
    return this.x;
  }
};
```


```
/** @extends {Bar} */ // <-- unnecessary @extends
exports.Baz = class extends Bar {
  /** @return {number} */
  method() {
    return this.x;
  }
};
```


#### 4.2.4 Function expressions


When declaring an anonymous function in the list of arguments for a function
call, the body of the function is indented two spaces more than the preceding
indentation depth.


Example:


```
prefix.something.reallyLongFunctionName('whatever', (a1, a2) => {
  // Indent the function body +2 relative to indentation depth
  // of the 'prefix' statement one line above.
  if (a1.equals(a2)) {
    someOtherLongFunctionName(a1);
  } else {
    andNowForSomethingCompletelyDifferent(a2.parrot);
  }
});

some.reallyLongFunctionCall(arg1, arg2, arg3)
    .thatsWrapped()
    .then((result) => {
      // Indent the function body +2 relative to the indentation depth
      // of the '.then()' call.
      if (result) {
        result.use();
      }
    });
```


#### 4.2.5 Switch statements


As with any other block, the contents of a switch block are indented +2.


After a switch label, a newline appears, and the indentation level is increased
+2, exactly as if a block were being opened. An explicit block may be used if
required by lexical scoping. The following switch label returns to the previous
indentation level, as if a block had been closed.


A blank line is optional between abreakand the following case.


Example:


```
switch (animal) {
  case Animal.BANDERSNATCH:
    handleBandersnatch();
    break;

  case Animal.JABBERWOCK:
    handleJabberwock();
    break;

  default:
    throw new Error('Unknown animal');
}
```


### 4.3 Statements


#### 4.3.1 One statement per line


Each statement is followed by a line-break.


#### 4.3.2 Semicolons are required


Every statement must be terminated with a semicolon. Relying on automatic
semicolon insertion is forbidden.


### 4.4 Column limit: 80


JavaScript code has a column limit of 80 characters. Except as noted below, any
line that would exceed this limit must be line-wrapped, as explained in??.


Exceptions:

- goog.module,goog.requireandgoog.requireTypestatements (see??and??).
- ES moduleimportandexport fromstatements (see??and??).
- Lines where obeying the column limit is not possible or would hinder
discoverability. Examples include:A long URL which should be clickable in source.A shell command intended to be copied-and-pasted.A long string literal which may need to be copied or searched for wholly
(e.g., a long file path).
- A long URL which should be clickable in source.
- A shell command intended to be copied-and-pasted.
- A long string literal which may need to be copied or searched for wholly
(e.g., a long file path).
- A long URL which should be clickable in source.
- A shell command intended to be copied-and-pasted.
- A long string literal which may need to be copied or searched for wholly
(e.g., a long file path).

### 4.5 Line-wrapping


Terminology Note:Line wrappingis breaking a chunk of code into multiple
lines to obey column limit, where the chunk could otherwise legally fit in a
single line.


There is no comprehensive, deterministic formula showingexactlyhow to
line-wrap in every situation. Very often there are several valid ways to
line-wrap the same piece of code.


Note: While the typical reason for line-wrapping is to avoid overflowing the
column limit, even code that would in fact fit within the column limit may be
line-wrapped at the author's discretion.


Tip: Extracting a method or local variable may solve the problem without the
need to line-wrap.


#### 4.5.1 Where to break


The prime directive of line-wrapping is: prefer to break at ahigher syntactic
level.


Preferred:


```
currentEstimate =
    calc(currentEstimate + x * currentEstimate) /
        2.0;
```


Discouraged:


```
currentEstimate = calc(currentEstimate + x *
    currentEstimate) / 2.0;
```


In the preceding example, the syntactic levels from highest to lowest are as
follows: assignment, division, function call, parameters, number constant.


Operators are wrapped as follows:

- When a line is broken at an operator the break comes after the symbol. (Note
that this is not the same practice used in Google style for Java.)This does not apply to thedot(.), which is not actually an
operator.
- This does not apply to thedot(.), which is not actually an
operator.
- A method or constructor name stays attached to the open parenthesis (()
that follows it.
- A comma (,) stays attached to the token that precedes it.
- A line break is never added between a return and the return value as this
would change the meaning of the code.
- JSDoc annotations with type names break after{. This is necessary as
annotations with optional types (@const, @private, @param, etc) do not scan
the next line.
- This does not apply to thedot(.), which is not actually an
operator.

Note: The primary goal for line wrapping is to have clear code, not
necessarily code that fits in the smallest number of lines.


#### 4.5.2 Indent continuation lines at least +4 spaces


When line-wrapping, each line after the first (eachcontinuation line) is
indented at least +4 from the original line, unless it falls under the rules of
block indentation.


When there are multiple continuation lines, indentation may be varied beyond +4
as appropriate. In general, continuation lines at a deeper syntactic level are
indented by larger multiples of 4, and two lines use the same indentation level
if and only if they begin with syntactically parallel elements.


??addresses the discouraged practice of
using a variable number of spaces to align certain tokens with previous lines.


### 4.6 Whitespace


#### 4.6.1 Vertical whitespace


A single blank line appears:

- Between consecutive methods in a class or object literalException: A blank line between two consecutive properties definitions
in an object literal (with no other code between them) is optional. Such
blank lines are used as needed to createlogical groupingsof fields.
- Exception: A blank line between two consecutive properties definitions
in an object literal (with no other code between them) is optional. Such
blank lines are used as needed to createlogical groupingsof fields.
- Within method bodies, sparingly to createlogical groupingsof statements.
Blank lines at the start or end of a function body are not allowed.
- Optionallybefore the first or after the last method in a class or object
literal (neither encouraged nor discouraged).
- As required by other sections of this document (e.g.??).
- Exception: A blank line between two consecutive properties definitions
in an object literal (with no other code between them) is optional. Such
blank lines are used as needed to createlogical groupingsof fields.

Multipleconsecutive blank lines are permitted, but never required (nor
encouraged).


#### 4.6.2 Horizontal whitespace


Use of horizontal whitespace depends on location, and falls into three broad
categories:leading(at the start of a line),trailing(at the end of a
line), andinternal. Leading whitespace (i.e., indentation) is addressed
elsewhere. Trailing whitespace is forbidden.


Beyond where required by the language or other style rules, and apart from
literals, comments, and JSDoc, a single internal ASCII space also appears in the
following placesonly.

- Separating any reserved word (such asif,for, orcatch) except forfunctionandsuper, from an open parenthesis (() that follows it on
that line.
- Separating any reserved word (such aselseorcatch) from a closing
curly brace (}) that precedes it on that line.
- Before any open curly brace ({), with two exceptions:Before an object literal that is the first argument of a function or the
first element in an array literal (e.g.foo({a: [{c: d}]})).In a template expansion, as it is forbidden by the language (e.g. valid:`ab${1 + 2}cd`, invalid:`xy$ {3}z`).
- Before an object literal that is the first argument of a function or the
first element in an array literal (e.g.foo({a: [{c: d}]})).
- In a template expansion, as it is forbidden by the language (e.g. valid:`ab${1 + 2}cd`, invalid:`xy$ {3}z`).
- On both sides of any binary or ternary operator.
- After a comma (,) or semicolon (;). Note that spaces areneverallowed
before these characters.
- After the colon (:) in an object literal.
- On both sides of the double slash (//) that begins an end-of-line comment.
Here, multiple spaces are allowed, but not required.
- After an open-block comment character and on both sides of close characters
(e.g. for short-form type declarations, casts, and parameter name comments:this.foo = /** @type {number} */ (bar); orfunction(/** string */ foo)
{; orbaz(/* buzz= */ true)).
- Before an object literal that is the first argument of a function or the
first element in an array literal (e.g.foo({a: [{c: d}]})).
- In a template expansion, as it is forbidden by the language (e.g. valid:`ab${1 + 2}cd`, invalid:`xy$ {3}z`).

#### 4.6.3 Horizontal alignment: discouraged


Terminology Note:Horizontal alignmentis the practice of adding a
variable number of additional spaces in your code with the goal of making
certain tokens appear directly below certain other tokens on previous lines.


This practice is permitted, but it isgenerally discouragedby Google Style.
It is not even required tomaintainhorizontal alignment in places where it
was already used.


Here is an example without alignment, followed by one with alignment. Both are
allowed, but the latter is discouraged:


```
{
  tiny: 42, // this is great
  longer: 435, // this too
};

{
  tiny:   42,  // permitted, but future edits
  longer: 435, // may leave it unaligned
};
```


Tip: Alignment can aid readability, but it creates problems for future
maintenance. Consider a future change that needs to touch just one line. This
change may leave the formerly-pleasing formatting mangled, and that is allowed.
More often it prompts the coder (perhaps you) to adjust whitespace on nearby
lines as well, possibly triggering a cascading series of reformattings. That
one-line change now has ablast radius.This can at worst result in pointless
busywork, but at best it still corrupts version history information, slows down
reviewers and exacerbates merge conflicts.


#### 4.6.4 Function arguments


Prefer to put all function arguments on the same line as the function name. If
doing so would exceed the 80-column limit, the arguments must be line-wrapped in
a readable way. To save space, you may wrap as close to 80 as possible, or put
each argument on its own line to enhance readability. Indentation should be four
spaces. Aligning to the parenthesis is allowed, but discouraged. Below are the
most common patterns for argument wrapping:


```
// Arguments start on a new line, indented four spaces. Preferred when the
// arguments don't fit on the same line with the function name (or the keyword
// "function") but fit entirely on the second line. Works with very long
// function names, survives renaming without reindenting, low on space.
doSomething(
    descriptiveArgumentOne, descriptiveArgumentTwo, descriptiveArgumentThree) {
  // …
}

// If the argument list is longer, wrap at 80. Uses less vertical space,
// but violates the rectangle rule and is thus not recommended.
doSomething(veryDescriptiveArgumentNumberOne, veryDescriptiveArgumentTwo,
    tableModelEventHandlerProxy, artichokeDescriptorAdapterIterator) {
  // …
}

// Four-space, one argument per line.  Works with long function names,
// survives renaming, and emphasizes each argument.
doSomething(
    veryDescriptiveArgumentNumberOne,
    veryDescriptiveArgumentTwo,
    tableModelEventHandlerProxy,
    artichokeDescriptorAdapterIterator) {
  // …
}
```


### 4.7 Grouping parentheses: recommended


Optional grouping parentheses are omitted only when the author and reviewer
agree that there is no reasonable chance that the code will be misinterpreted
without them, nor would they have made the code easier to read. It isnotreasonable to assume that every reader has the entire operator precedence table
memorized.


Do not use unnecessary parentheses around the entire expression followingdelete,typeof,void,return,throw,case,in,of, oryield.


Parentheses are required for type casts:/** @type {!Foo} */ (foo).


### 4.8 Comments


This section addressesimplementation comments. JSDoc is addressed separately
in??.


#### 4.8.1 Block comment style


Block comments are indented at the same level as the surrounding code. They may
be in/* … */or//-style. For multi-line/* … */comments, subsequent
lines must start with*aligned with the*on the previous line, to make
comments obvious with no extra context.


```
/*
 * This is
 * okay.
 */

// And so
// is this.

/* This is fine, too. */
```


Comments are not enclosed in boxes drawn with asterisks or other characters.


Do not use JSDoc (/** … */) for implementation comments.


#### 4.8.2 Parameter Name Comments


“Parameter name” comments should be used whenever the value and method name do
not sufficiently convey the meaning, and refactoring the method to be clearer is
infeasible .
Their preferred format is before the value with=:


```
someFunction(obviousParam, /* shouldRender= */ true, /* name= */ 'hello');
```


For consistency with surrounding code you may put them after the value without=:


```
someFunction(obviousParam, true /* shouldRender */, 'hello' /* name */);
```


## 5 Language features


JavaScript includes many dubious (and even dangerous) features. This section
delineates which features may or may not be used, and any additional constraints
on their use.


Language features which are not discussed in this style guide may be used with
no recommendations of their usage.


### 5.1 Local variable declarations


#### 5.1.1 Useconstandlet


Declare all local variables with eitherconstorlet. Useconstby
default, unless a variable needs to be reassigned. Thevarkeyword
must not be used.


#### 5.1.2 One variable per declaration


Every local variable declaration declares only one variable: declarations such
aslet a = 1, b = 2;are not used.


#### 5.1.3 Declared when needed, initialized as soon as possible


Local variables arenothabitually declared at the start of their containing
block or block-like construct. Instead, local variables are declared close to
the point they are first used (within reason), to minimize their scope, and
initialized as soon as possible.


#### 5.1.4 Declare types as needed


JSDoc type annotations may be added either on the line above the declaration, or
else inline before the variable name if no other JSDoc is present.


Example:


```
const /** !Array<number> */ data = [];

/**
 * Some description.
 * @type {!Array<number>}
 */
const data = [];
```


Mixing inline and JSDoc styles is not allowed: the compiler will only process
the first JsDoc and the inline annotations will be lost.


```
/** Some description. */
const /** !Array<number> */ data = [];
```


Tip: There are many cases where the compiler can infer a templatized type but
not its parameters. This is particularly the case when the initializing literal
or constructor call does not include any values of the template parameter type
(e.g., empty arrays, objects,Maps, orSets), or if the variable is modified
in a closure. Local variable type annotations are particularly helpful in these
cases since otherwise the compiler will infer the template parameter as unknown.


### 5.2 Array literals


#### 5.2.1 Use trailing commas


Include a trailing comma whenever there is a line break between the final
element and the closing bracket.


Example:


```
const values = [
  'first value',
  'second value',
];
```


#### 5.2.2 Do not use the variadicArrayconstructor


The constructor is error-prone if arguments are added or removed. Use a literal
instead.


Disallowed:


```
const a1 = new Array(x1, x2, x3);
const a2 = new Array(x1, x2);
const a3 = new Array(x1);
const a4 = new Array();
```


This works as expected except for the third case: ifx1is a whole number thena3is an array of sizex1where all elements areundefined. Ifx1is any
other number, then an exception will be thrown, and if it is anything else then
it will be a single-element array.


Instead, write


```
const a1 = [x1, x2, x3];
const a2 = [x1, x2];
const a3 = [x1];
const a4 = [];
```


Explicitly allocating an array of a given length usingnew Array(length)is
allowed when appropriate.


#### 5.2.3 Non-numeric properties


Do not define or use non-numeric properties on an array (other thanlength).
Use aMap(orObject) instead.


#### 5.2.4 Destructuring


Array literals may be used on the left-hand side of an assignment to perform
destructuring (such as when unpacking multiple values from a single array or
iterable). A finalrestelement may be included (with no space between the...and the variable name). Elements should be omitted if they are unused.


```
const [a, b, c, ...rest] = generateResults();
let [, b,, d] = someArray;
```


Destructuring may also be used for function parameters (note that a parameter
name is required but ignored). Always specify[]as the default value if a
destructured array parameter is optional, and provide default values on the left
hand side:


```
/** @param {!Array<number>=} param1 */
function optionalDestructuring([a = 4, b = 2] = []) { … };
```


Disallowed:


```
function badDestructuring([a, b] = [4, 2]) { … };
```


Tip: For (un)packing multiple values into a function’s parameter or return,
prefer object destructuring to array destructuring when possible, as it allows
naming the individual elements and specifying a different type for each.


#### 5.2.5 Spread operator


Array literals may include the spread operator (...) to flatten elements out
of one or more other iterables. The spread operator should be used instead of
more awkward constructs withArray.prototype. There is no space after the....


Example:


```
[...foo]   // preferred over Array.prototype.slice.call(foo)
[...foo, ...bar]   // preferred over foo.concat(bar)
```


### 5.3 Object literals


#### 5.3.1 Use trailing commas


Include a trailing comma whenever there is a line break between the final
property and the closing brace.


#### 5.3.2 Do not use theObjectconstructor


WhileObjectdoes not have the same problems asArray, it is still
disallowed for consistency. Use an object literal ({}or{a: 0, b: 1, c: 2})
instead.


#### 5.3.3 Do not mix quoted and unquoted keys


Object literals may represent eitherstructs(with unquoted keys and/or
symbols) ordicts(with quoted and/or computed keys). Do not mix these key
types in a single object literal.


Disallowed:


```
{
  width: 42, // struct-style unquoted key
  'maxWidth': 43, // dict-style quoted key
}
```


This also extends to passing the property name to functions, likehasOwnProperty. In particular, doing so will break in compiled code because
the compiler cannot rename/obfuscate the string literal.


Disallowed:


```
/** @type {{width: number, maxWidth: (number|undefined)}} */
const o = {width: 42};
if (o.hasOwnProperty('maxWidth')) {
  ...
}
```


This is best implemented as:


```
/** @type {{width: number, maxWidth: (number|undefined)}} */
const o = {width: 42};
if (o.maxWidth != null) {
  ...
}
```


#### 5.3.4 Computed property names


Computed property names (e.g.,{['key' + foo()]: 42}) are allowed, and are
considered dict-style (quoted) keys (i.e., must not be mixed with non-quoted
keys) unless the computed property is asymbol(e.g.,[Symbol.iterator]). Enum values may also be used for computed keys, but
should not be mixed with non-enum keys in the same literal.


#### 5.3.5 Method shorthand


Methods can be defined on object literals using the method shorthand ({method()
{… }}) in place of a colon immediately followed by afunctionor arrow
function literal.


Example:


```
return {
  stuff: 'candy',
  method() {
    return this.stuff;  // Returns 'candy'
  },
};
```


Note thatthisin a method shorthand orfunctionrefers to the object
literal itself whereasthisin an arrow function refers to the scope outside
the object literal.


Example:


```
class {
  getObjectLiteral() {
    this.stuff = 'fruit';
    return {
      stuff: 'candy',
      method: () => this.stuff,  // Returns 'fruit'
    };
  }
}
```


#### 5.3.6 Shorthand properties


Shorthand properties are allowed on object literals.


Example:


```
const foo = 1;
const bar = 2;
const obj = {
  foo,
  bar,
  method() { return this.foo + this.bar; },
};
assertEquals(3, obj.method());
```


#### 5.3.7 Destructuring


Object destructuring patterns may be used on the left-hand side of an assignment
to perform destructuring and unpack multiple values from a single object.


Destructured objects may also be used as function parameters, but should be kept
as simple as possible: a single level of unquoted shorthand properties. Deeper
levels of nesting and computed properties may not be used in parameter
destructuring. Specify any default values in the left-hand-side of the
destructured parameter ({str = 'some default'} = {}, rather than{str} = {str: 'some default'}), and if a
destructured object is itself optional, it must default to{}. The JSDoc for
the destructured parameter may be given any name (the name is unused but is
required by the compiler).


Example:


```
/**
 * @param {string} ordinary
 * @param {{num: (number|undefined), str: (string|undefined)}=} param1
 *     num: The number of times to do something.
 *     str: A string to do stuff to.
 */
function destructured(ordinary, {num, str = 'some default'} = {}) {}
```


Disallowed:


```
/** @param {{x: {num: (number|undefined), str: (string|undefined)}}} param1 */
function nestedTooDeeply({x: {num, str}}) {};
/** @param {{num: (number|undefined), str: (string|undefined)}=} param1 */
function nonShorthandProperty({num: a, str: b} = {}) {};
/** @param {{a: number, b: number}} param1 */
function computedKey({a, b, [a + b]: c}) {};
/** @param {{a: number, b: string}=} param1 */
function nontrivialDefault({a, b} = {a: 2, b: 4}) {};
```


Destructuring may also be used forgoog.requirestatements, and in this case
must not be wrapped: the entire statement occupies one line, regardless of how
long it is (see??).


#### 5.3.8 Enums


Enumerations are defined by adding the@enumannotation to an object literal.
Enums must be module-local or assigned directly onexports, not nested under a
type or object.


Additional properties may not be added to an enum after it is defined. Enums
must be constant. All enum values must be either a string literal or a number.


```
/**
 * Supported temperature scales.
 * @enum {string}
 */
const TemperatureScale = {
  CELSIUS: 'celsius',
  FAHRENHEIT: 'fahrenheit',
};

/**
 * An enum with two values.
 * @enum {number}
 */
const Value = {
  /** The value used shall have been the first. */
  FIRST_VALUE: 1,
  /** The second among two values. */
  SECOND_VALUE: 2,
};
```


For string enums, all values must be statically initialized and not computed
using arithmetic operators, template literal substitution, function calls or
even a variable reference.


```
const ABSOLUTE_ZERO = '-273°F';

/**
 * Not supported computed values in string enum.
 * @enum {string}
 */
const TemperatureInFahrenheit = {
  MIN_POSSIBLE: ABSOLUTE_ZERO,
  ZERO_FAHRENHEIT: 0 + '°F',
  ONE_FAHRENHEIT: `${Values.FIRST_VALUE}°F`,
  TWO_FAHRENHEIT: Values.SECOND_VALUE + '°F',
  SOME_FAHRENHEIT: getTemperatureInFahrenheit() + '°F',
};
```


Note: Although TypeScript supports a few more patterns for enum values (e.gA:
'a'+'b', etc), the restriction of only allowing string literals and numbers for
enum values is to aid migration to TypeScript. For complex values consider using
a const object without@enum.


### 5.4 Classes


#### 5.4.1 Constructors


Constructors are optional. Subclass constructors must callsuper()before
setting any fields or otherwise accessingthis. Interfaces should declare
non-method properties in the constructor.


#### 5.4.2 Fields


Define all of a concrete object’s fields (i.e. all properties other than
methods) in the constructor. Annotate fields that are never reassigned with@const(these need not be deeply immutable). Annotate non-public fields with
the proper visibility annotation (@private,@protected,@package).@privatefields' names may optionally end with an underscore. Fields must not
be defined within a nested scope in the constructor nor on a concrete class'sprototype.


Example:


```
class Foo {
  constructor() {
    /** @private @const {!Bar} */
    this.bar_ = computeBar();

    /** @protected @const {!Baz} */
    this.baz = computeBaz();
  }
}
```


Tip: Properties should never be added to or removed from an instance after the
constructor is finished, since it significantly hinders VMs’ ability to
optimize. If necessary, fields that are initialized later should be explicitly
set toundefinedin the constructor to prevent later shape changes. Adding@structto an object will check that undeclared properties are not
added/accessed. Classes have this added by default.


#### 5.4.3 Computed properties


Computed properties may only be used in classes when the property is a symbol.
Dict-style properties (that is, quoted or computed non-symbol keys, as defined
in??) are not allowed. A[Symbol.iterator]method should be defined for any classes that are logically iterable. Beyond
this,Symbolshould be used sparingly.


Tip: be careful of using any other built-in symbols (e.g.,Symbol.isConcatSpreadable) as they are not polyfilled by the compiler and will
therefore not work in older browsers.


#### 5.4.4 Static methods


Where it does not interfere with readability, prefer module-local functions over
private static methods.


Code should not rely on dynamic dispatch of static methods, because it
interferes with Closure Compiler optimizations. Static methods should only be
called on the base class itself. Static methods should not be called on
variables containing a dynamic instance that may be either the constructor or a
subclass constructor (and must be defined with@nocollapseif this is done),
and must not be called directly on a subclass that doesn’t define the method
itself. Do not accessthisin static methods.


Disallowed:


```
// Context for the examples below; by itself this code is allowed.
class Base {
  /** @nocollapse */ static foo() {}
}
class Sub extends Base {}

// discouraged: don't call static methods dynamically
function callFoo(cls) { cls.foo(); }

// Disallowed: don't call static methods on subclasses that don't define it themselves
Sub.foo();

// Disallowed: don't access this in static methods.
class Clazz {
  static foo() {
    return this.staticField;
  }
}
Class.staticField = 1;
```


#### 5.4.5 Old-style class declarations


While ES6 classes are preferred, there are cases where ES6 classes may not be
feasible. For example:

- If there exist or will exist subclasses, including frameworks that create
subclasses, that cannot be immediately changed to use ES6 class syntax. If
such a class were to use ES6 syntax, all downstream subclasses not using ES6
class syntax would need to be modified.
- Frameworks that require a knownthisvalue before calling the superclass
constructor, since constructors with ES6 super classes do not have access to
the instancethisvalue until the call tosuperreturns.

If there exist or will exist subclasses, including frameworks that create
subclasses, that cannot be immediately changed to use ES6 class syntax. If
such a class were to use ES6 syntax, all downstream subclasses not using ES6
class syntax would need to be modified.


Frameworks that require a knownthisvalue before calling the superclass
constructor, since constructors with ES6 super classes do not have access to
the instancethisvalue until the call tosuperreturns.


In all other ways the style guide still applies to this code:let,const,
default parameters, rest, and arrow functions should all be used when
appropriate.


goog.defineClassallows for a class-like definition similar to ES6 class
syntax:


```
let C = goog.defineClass(S, {
  /**
   * @param {string} value
   */
  constructor(value) {
    S.call(this, 2);
    /** @const */
    this.prop = value;
  },

  /**
   * @param {string} param
   * @return {number}
   */
  method(param) {
    return 0;
  },
});
```


Alternatively, whilegoog.defineClassshould be preferred for all new code,
more traditional syntax is also allowed.


```
/**
  * @constructor @extends {S}
  * @param {string} value
  */
function C(value) {
  S.call(this, 2);
  /** @const */
  this.prop = value;
}
goog.inherits(C, S);

/**
 * @param {string} param
 * @return {number}
 */
C.prototype.method = function(param) {
  return 0;
};
```


Per-instance properties should be defined in the constructor after the call to
the super class constructor, if there is a super class. Methods should be
defined on the prototype of the constructor.


Defining constructor prototype hierarchies correctly is harder than it first
appears! For that reason, it is best to usegoog.inheritsfromthe Closure Library.


#### 5.4.6 Do not manipulateprototypes directly


Theclasskeyword allows clearer and more readable class definitions than
definingprototypeproperties. Ordinary implementation code has no business
manipulating these objects, though they are still useful for defining classes as
defined in??. Mixins and modifying the
prototypes of builtin objects are explicitly forbidden.


Exception: Framework code (such as Polymer, or Angular) may need to useprototypes, and should not resort
to even-worse workarounds to avoid doing so.


#### 5.4.7 Getters and Setters


Do not useJavaScript getter and setter properties. They are potentially
surprising and difficult to reason about, and have limited support in the
compiler. Provide ordinary methods instead.


Exception: there are situations where defining a getter or setter is
unavoidable (e.g. data binding frameworks such as Angular and Polymer, or for
compatibility with external APIs that cannot be adjusted). In these cases only,
getters and setters may be usedwith caution, provided they are defined with
thegetandsetshorthand method keywords orObject.defineProperties(notObject.defineProperty, which interferes with property renaming). Gettersmust notchange observable state.


Disallowed:


```
class Foo {
  get next() { return this.nextId++; }
}
```


#### 5.4.8 Overriding toString


ThetoStringmethod may be overridden, but must always succeed and never have
visible side effects.


Tip: Beware, in particular, of calling other methods from toString, since
exceptional conditions could lead to infinite loops.


#### 5.4.9 Interfaces


Interfaces may be declared with@interfaceor@record. Interfaces declared
with@recordcan be explicitly (i.e. via@implements) or implicitly
implemented by a class or object literal.


All methods on an interface must be non-static and method bodies must be empty
blocks. Fields must be declared as uninitialized members in the class
constructor.


Example:


```
/**
 * Something that can frobnicate.
 * @record
 */
class Frobnicator {
  constructor() {
    /** @type {number} The number of attempts before giving up. */
    this.attempts;
  }

  /**
   * Performs the frobnication according to the given strategy.
   * @param {!FrobnicationStrategy} strategy
   */
  frobnicate(strategy) {}
}
```


#### 5.4.10 Abstract Classes


Use abstract classes when appropriate. Abstract classes and methods must be
annotated with@abstract. Do not usegoog.abstractMethod. Seeabstract classes and methods.


#### 5.4.11 Do not create static container classes


Do not use container classes with only static methods or properties for the sake
of namespacing.


```
// container.js
// Bad: Container is an exported class that has only static methods and fields.
class Container {
  /** @return {number} */
  static bar() {
    return 1;
  }
}

/** @const {number} */
Container.FOO = 1;

exports = {Container};
```


Instead, export individual constants and functions:


```
/** @return {number} */
exports.bar = () => {
  return 1;
}

/** @const {number} */
exports.FOO = 1;
```


#### 5.4.12 Do not define nested namespaces


Do not define a nested type (e.g. class, typedef, enum, interface) on another
module-local name.


```
// foo.js
goog.module('my.namespace');

class Foo {...}

Foo.Bar = class {...};

/** @enum {number} */
Foo.Baz = {...};

/** @typedef {{value: number}} */
Foo.Qux;

/** @interface */
Foo.Quuz = class {...}

exports.Foo = Foo;
```


These values should be top-level exports. Choose clear names for these values
(e.g. FooConverter for a Converter that could have been nested on Foo). However,
when the module name is redundant with part of the class name, consider omitting
the redundancy:foo.Fooandfoo.Converterrather thanfoo.Fooandfoo.FooConverter. Importers can add the prefix when necessary for clarity
(e.g.import {Converter as FooConverter} from './foo';) but cannot easily
remove the redundancy when importing the entire module as a namespace.


```
// foo.js
goog.module('my.namespace');

class Foo {...}

class FooBar {...}

/** @enum {string} */
let FooBaz = {...};

/** @typedef {{value: number}} */
let FooQux;

/** @interface */
class FooQuuz {...};

export = {
  Foo,
  FooBar,
  FooBaz,
  FooQux,
  FooQuuz,
};
```


### 5.5 Functions


#### 5.5.1 Top-level functions


Top-level functions may be defined directly on theexportsobject, or else
declared locally and optionally exported. See??for more on exports.


Examples:


```
/** @param {string} str */
exports.processString = (str) => {
  // Process the string.
};
```


```
/** @param {string} str */
const processString = (str) => {
  // Process the string.
};

exports = {processString};
```


#### 5.5.2 Nested functions and closures


Functions may contain nested function definitions. If it is useful to give the
function a name, it should be assigned to a localconst.


#### 5.5.3 Arrow functions


Arrow functions provide a concise function syntax and simplify scopingthisfor nested functions. Prefer arrow functions over thefunctionkeyword for
nested functions (but see??).


Prefer arrow functions over otherthisscoping approaches such asf.bind(this),goog.bind(f, this), andconst self = this. Arrow functions
are particularly useful for calling into callbacks as they permit explicitly
specifying which parameters to pass to the callback whereas binding will blindly
pass along all parameters.


The left-hand side of the arrow contains zero or more parameters. Parentheses
around the parameters are optional if there is only a single non-destructured
parameter. When parentheses are used, inline parameter types may be specified
(see??).


Tip: Always using parentheses even for single-parameter arrow functions can
avoid situations where adding parameters, but forgetting to add parentheses, may
result in parseable code which no longer works as intended.


The right-hand side of the arrow contains the body of the function. By default
the body is a block statement (zero or more statements surrounded by curly
braces). The body may also be an implicitly returned single expression if
either: the program logic requires returning a value, or thevoidoperator
precedes a single function or method call (usingvoidensuresundefinedis
returned, prevents leaking values, and communicates intent). The single
expression form is preferred if it improves readability (e.g., for short or
simple expressions).


Examples:


```
/**
 * Arrow functions can be documented just like normal functions.
 * @param {number} numParam A number to add.
 * @param {string} strParam Another number to add that happens to be a string.
 * @return {number} The sum of the two parameters.
 */
const moduleLocalFunc = (numParam, strParam) => numParam + Number(strParam);

// Uses the single expression syntax with `void` because the program logic does
// not require returning a value.
getValue((result) => void alert(`Got ${result}`));

class CallbackExample {
  constructor() {
    /** @private {number} */
    this.cachedValue_ = 0;

    // For inline callbacks, you can use inline typing for parameters.
    // Uses a block statement because the value of the single expression should
    // not be returned and the expression is not a single function call.
    getNullableValue((/** ?number */ result) => {
      this.cachedValue_ = result == null ? 0 : result;
    });
  }
}
```


Disallowed:


```
/**
 * A function with no params and no returned value.
 * This single expression body usage is illegal because the program logic does
 * not require returning a value and we're missing the `void` operator.
 */
const moduleLocalFunc = () => anotherFunction();
```


#### 5.5.4 Generators


Generators enable a number of useful abstractions and may be used as needed.


When defining generator functions, attach the*to thefunctionkeyword when
present, and separate it with a space from the name of the function. When using
delegating yields, attach the*to theyieldkeyword.


Example:


```
/** @return {!Iterator<number>} */
function* gen1() {
  yield 42;
}

/** @return {!Iterator<number>} */
const gen2 = function*() {
  yield* gen1();
}

class SomeClass {
  /** @return {!Iterator<number>} */
  * gen() {
    yield 42;
  }
}
```


#### 5.5.5 Parameter and return types


Function parameters and return types should usually be documented with JSDoc
annotations. See??for more information.


Optional parameters are permitted using the equals operator in the parameter
list. Optional parameters must include spaces on both sides of the equals
operator, be named exactly like required parameters (i.e., not prefixed withopt_), use the=suffix in their JSDoc type, come after required parameters,
and not use initializers that produce observable side effects. All optional
parameters for concrete functions must have default values, even if that value
isundefined. In contrast to concrete functions, abstract and interface
methods must omit default parameter values.


Example:


```
/**
 * @param {string} required This parameter is always needed.
 * @param {string=} optional This parameter can be omitted.
 * @param {!Node=} node Another optional parameter.
 */
function maybeDoSomething(required, optional = '', node = undefined) {}

/** @interface */
class MyInterface {
  /**
   * Interface and abstract methods must omit default parameter values.
   * @param {string=} optional
   */
  someMethod(optional) {}
}
```


Use default parameters sparingly. Prefer destructuring (as in??) to create readable APIs when there are
more than a small handful of optional parameters that do not have a natural
order.


Note: Unlike Python's default parameters, it is okay to use initializers that
return new mutable objects (such as{}or[]) because the initializer is
evaluated each time the default value is used, so a single object won't be
shared across invocations.


Tip: While arbitrary expressions including function calls may be used as
initializers, these should be kept as simple as possible. Avoid initializers
that expose shared mutable state, as that can easily introduce unintended
coupling between function calls.


Use arestparameter instead of accessingarguments. Rest parameters are
typed with a...prefix in their JSDoc. The rest parameter must be the last
parameter in the list. There is no space between the...and the parameter
name. Do not name the rest parametervar_args. Never name a local variable or
parameterarguments, which confusingly shadows the built-in name.


Example:


```
/**
 * @param {!Array<string>} array This is an ordinary parameter.
 * @param {...number} numbers The remainder of arguments are all numbers.
 */
function variadic(array, ...numbers) {}
```


#### 5.5.6 Generics


Declare generic functions and methods when necessary with@template TYPEin
the JSDoc above the function or method definition.


#### 5.5.7 Spread operator


Function calls may use the spread operator (...). Prefer the spread operator
toFunction.prototype.applywhen an array or iterable is unpacked into
multiple parameters of a variadic function. There is no space after the....


Example:


```
function myFunction(...elements) {}
myFunction(...array, ...iterable, ...generator());
```


### 5.6 String literals


#### 5.6.1 Use single quotes


Ordinary string literals are delimited with single quotes ('), rather than
double quotes (").


Tip: if a string contains a single quote character, consider using a template
string to avoid having to escape the quote.


Ordinary string literals may not span multiple lines.


#### 5.6.2 Template literals


Use template literals (delimited with`) over complex string
concatenation, particularly if multiple string literals are involved. Template
literals may span multiple lines.


If a template literal spans multiple lines, it does not need to follow the
indentation of the enclosing block, though it may if the added whitespace does
not matter.


Example:


```
function arithmetic(a, b) {
  return `Here is a table of arithmetic operations:
${a} + ${b} = ${a + b}
${a} - ${b} = ${a - b}
${a} * ${b} = ${a * b}
${a} / ${b} = ${a / b}`;
}
```


#### 5.6.3 No line continuations


Do not useline continuations(that is, ending a line inside a string literal
with a backslash) in either ordinary or template string literals. Even though
ES5 allows this, it can lead to tricky errors if any trailing whitespace comes
after the slash, and is less obvious to readers.


Disallowed:


```
const longString = 'This is a very long string that far exceeds the 80 \
    column limit. It unfortunately contains long stretches of spaces due \
    to how the continued lines are indented.';
```


Instead, write


```
const longString = 'This is a very long string that far exceeds the 80 ' +
    'column limit. It does not contain long stretches of spaces since ' +
    'the concatenated strings are cleaner.';
```


### 5.7 Number literals


Numbers may be specified in decimal, hex, octal, or binary. Use exactly0x,0o, and0bprefixes, with lowercase letters, for hex, octal, and binary,
respectively. Never include a leading zero unless it is immediately followed byx,o, orb.


### 5.8 Control structures


#### 5.8.1 For loops


With ES6, the language now has three different kinds offorloops. All may be
used, thoughfor-ofloops should be preferred when possible.


for-inloops may only be used on dict-style objects (see??), and should not be used to iterate over an
array.Object.prototype.hasOwnPropertyshould be used infor-inloops to
exclude unwanted prototype properties. Preferfor-ofandObject.keysoverfor-inwhen possible.


#### 5.8.2 Exceptions


Exceptions are an important part of the language and should be used whenever
exceptional cases occur. Always throwErrors or subclasses ofError: never
throw string literals or other objects. Always usenewwhen constructing anError.


This treatment extends toPromiserejection values asPromise.reject(obj)is
equivalent tothrow obj;in async functions.


Custom exceptions provide a great way to convey additional error information
from functions. They should be defined and used wherever the nativeErrortype
is insufficient.


Prefer throwing exceptions over ad-hoc error-handling approaches (such as
passing an error container reference type, or returning an object with an error
property).


It is very rarely correct to do nothing in response to a caught exception. When
it truly is appropriate to take no action whatsoever in a catch block, the
reason this is justified is explained in a comment.


```
try {
  return handleNumericResponse(response);
} catch (ok) {
  // it's not numeric; that's fine, just continue
}
return handleTextResponse(response);
```


Disallowed:


```
try {
    shouldFail();
    fail('expected an error');
  } catch (expected) {
  }
```


Tip: Unlike in some other languages, patterns like the above simply don’t work
since this will catch the error thrown byfail. UseassertThrows()instead.


#### 5.8.3 Switch statements


Terminology Note: Inside the braces of a switch block are one or more statement
groups. Each statement group consists of one or more switch labels (eithercase
FOO:ordefault:), followed by one or more statements.


Within a switch block, each statement group either terminates abruptly (with abreak,returnorthrown exception), or is marked with a comment to
indicate that execution will or might continue into the next statement group.
Any comment that communicates the idea of fall-through is sufficient (typically// fall through). This special comment is not required in the last statement
group of the switch block.


Example:


```
switch (input) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
    prepareOneOrTwo();
  // fall through
  case 3:
    handleOneTwoOrThree();
    break;
  default:
    handleLargeNumber(input);
}
```


Each switch statement includes adefaultstatement group, even if it contains
no code. Thedefaultstatement group must be last.


### 5.9 this


Only usethisin class constructors and methods, in arrow functions defined
within class constructors and methods, or in functions that have an explicit@thisdeclared in the immediately-enclosing function’s JSDoc.


Never usethisto refer to the global object, the context of aneval, the
target of an event, or unnecessarilycall()ed orapply()ed functions.


### 5.10 Equality Checks


Use identity operators (===/!==) except in the cases documented below.


#### 5.10.1 Exceptions Where Coercion is Desirable


Catching bothnullandundefinedvalues:


```
if (someObjectOrPrimitive == null) {
  // Checking for null catches both null and undefined for objects and
  // primitives, but does not catch other falsy values like 0 or the empty
  // string.
}
```


### 5.11 Disallowed features


#### 5.11.1 with


Do not use thewithkeyword. It makes your code harder to understand and has
been banned in strict mode since ES5.


#### 5.11.2 Dynamic code evaluation


Do not useevalor theFunction(...string)constructor (except for code
loaders). These features are potentially dangerous and simply do not work in CSP
environments.


#### 5.11.3 Automatic semicolon insertion


Always terminate statements with semicolons (except function and class
declarations, as noted above).


#### 5.11.4 Non-standard features


Do not use non-standard features. This includes old features that have been
removed (e.g.,WeakMap.clear), new features that are not yet standardized
(e.g., the current TC39 working draft, proposals at any stage, or proposed but
not-yet-complete web standards), or proprietary features that are only
implemented in some browsers. Use only features defined in the current ECMA-262
or WHATWG standards. (Note that projects writing against specific APIs, such as
Chrome extensions or Node.js, can obviously use those APIs). Non-standard
language “extensions” (such as those provided by some external transpilers) are
forbidden.


#### 5.11.5 Wrapper objects for primitive types


Never usenewon the primitive object wrappers (Boolean,Number,String,Symbol), nor include them in type annotations.


Disallowed:


```
const /** Boolean */ x = new Boolean(false);
if (x) alert(typeof x);  // alerts 'object' - WAT?
```


The wrappers may be called as functions for coercing (which is preferred over
using+or concatenating the empty string) or creating symbols.


Example:


```
const /** boolean */ x = Boolean(0);
if (!x) alert(typeof x);  // alerts 'boolean', as expected
```


#### 5.11.6 Modifying builtin objects


Never modify builtin types, either by adding methods to their constructors or to
their prototypes. Avoid depending on libraries that do this. Note that the
JSCompiler’s runtime library will provide standards-compliant polyfills where
possible; nothing else may modify builtin objects.


Do not add symbols to the global object unless absolutely necessary (e.g.
required by a third-party API).


#### 5.11.7 Omitting()when invoking a constructor


Never invoke a constructor in anewstatement without using parentheses().


Disallowed:


```
new Foo;
```


Use instead:


```
new Foo();
```


Omitting parentheses can lead to subtle mistakes. These two lines are not
equivalent:


```
new Foo().Bar();
new Foo.Bar();
```


## 6 Naming


### 6.1 Rules common to all identifiers


Identifiers use only ASCII letters and digits, and, in a small number of cases
noted below, underscores and very rarely (when required by frameworks like
Angular) dollar signs.


Give as descriptive a name as possible, within reason. Do not worry about saving
horizontal space as it is far more important to make your code immediately
understandable by a new reader. Do not use abbreviations that are ambiguous or
unfamiliar to readers outside your project, and do not abbreviate by deleting
letters within a word.


```
errorCount          // No abbreviation.
dnsConnectionIndex  // Most people know what "DNS" stands for.
referrerUrl         // Ditto for "URL".
customerId          // "Id" is both ubiquitous and unlikely to be misunderstood.
```


Disallowed:


```
n                   // Meaningless.
nErr                // Ambiguous abbreviation.
nCompConns          // Ambiguous abbreviation.
wgcConnections      // Only your group knows what this stands for.
pcReader            // Lots of things can be abbreviated "pc".
cstmrId             // Deletes internal letters.
kSecondsPerDay      // Do not use Hungarian notation.
```


Exception: Variables that are in scope for 10 lines or fewer, including
arguments that arenotpart of an exported API,mayuse short (e.g. single
letter) variable names.


### 6.2 Rules by identifier type


#### 6.2.1 Package names


Package names are alllowerCamelCase. For example,my.exampleCode.deepSpace,
but notmy.examplecode.deepspaceormy.example_code.deep_space.


Exception: The package name may conform to TypeScript's path-based pattern. This is
typically all lower case with underscores where present in filenames.


#### 6.2.2 Class names


Class, interface, record, and typedef names are written inUpperCamelCase.
Unexported classes are simply locals: they are not marked@private.


Type names are typically nouns or noun phrases. For example,Request,ImmutableView, orVisibilityMode. Additionally, interface names may
sometimes be adjectives or adjective phrases instead (for example,Readable).


#### 6.2.3 Method names


Method names are written inlowerCamelCase. Names for@privatemethods may
optionally end with a trailing underscore.


Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases. For example,sendMessageorstop_. Getter and setter methods for properties are never required, but if
they are used they should be namedgetFoo(or optionallyisFooorhasFoofor booleans), orsetFoo(value)for setters.


Underscores may also appear in JsUnit test method names to separate logical
components of the name. One typical pattern istest<MethodUnderTest>_<state>_<expectedOutcome>, for exampletestPop_emptyStack_throws. There is no One Correct Way to name test methods.


#### 6.2.4 Enum names


Enum names are written inUpperCamelCase, similar to classes, and should
generally be singular nouns. Individual items within the enum are named inCONSTANT_CASE.


#### 6.2.5 Constant names


Constant names useCONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with words separated
by underscores. There is no reason for a constant to be named with a trailing
underscore, since private static properties can be replaced by (implicitly
private) module locals.


Every constant is a@conststatic property or a module-localconstdeclaration, but not all@conststatic properties and module-localconsts
are constants. Before choosing constant case, consider whether the field really
feels like adeeply immutableconstant. For example, if any of that instance's
observable state can change, it is almost certainly not a constant. Merely
intending to never mutate the object is generally not enough.


Examples:


```
// Constants
const NUMBER = 5;
/** @const */ exports.NAMES = goog.debug.freeze(['Ed', 'Ann']);
/** @enum */ exports.SomeEnum = { ENUM_CONSTANT: 'value' };

// Not constants
let letVariable = 'non-const';

class MyClass {
  constructor() { /** @const {string} */ this.nonStatic = 'non-static'; }
};
/** @type {string} */
MyClass.staticButMutable = 'not @const, can be reassigned';

const /** Set<string> */ mutableCollection = new Set();

const /** MyImmutableContainer<SomeMutableType> */ stillMutable =
    new MyImmutableContainer(mutableInner);

const {Foo} = goog.require('my.foo');  // mirrors imported name

const logger = log.getLogger('loggers.are.not.immutable');
```


Constants’ names are typically nouns or noun phrases.


Local aliases should be used whenever they improve readability over
fully-qualified names. Follow the same rules asgoog.requires
(??), maintaining the last part of the aliased name.
Aliases may also be used within functions. Aliases must beconst.


Examples:


```
const staticHelper = importedNamespace.staticHelper;
const CONSTANT_NAME = ImportedClass.CONSTANT_NAME;
const {assert, assertInstanceof} = asserts;
```


#### 6.2.6 Non-constant field names


Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written inlowerCamelCase,
with an optional trailing underscore for private fields.


These names are typically nouns or noun phrases. For example,computedValuesorindex_.


#### 6.2.7 Parameter names


Parameter names are written inlowerCamelCase. Note that this applies even if
the parameter expects a constructor.


One-character parameter names should not be used in public methods.


Exception: When required by a third-party framework, parameter names may
begin with a$. This exception does not apply to any other identifiers (e.g.
local variables or properties).


#### 6.2.8 Local variable names


Local variable names are written inlowerCamelCase, except for module-local
(top-level) constants, as described above. Constants in function scopes are
still named inlowerCamelCase. Note thatlowerCamelCaseis used
even if the variable holds a constructor.


#### 6.2.9 Template parameter names


Template parameter names should be concise, single-word or single-letter
identifiers, and must be all-caps, such asTYPEorTHIS.


#### 6.2.10 Module-local names


Module-local names that are not exported are implicitly private. They are not
marked@private. This applies to classes, functions, variables, constants,
enums, and other module-local identifiers.


### 6.3 Camel case: defined


Sometimes there is more than one reasonable way to convert an English phrase
into camel case, such as when acronyms or unusual constructs likeIPv6oriOSare present. To improve predictability, Google Style specifies the
following (nearly) deterministic scheme.


Beginning with the prose form of the name:

- Convert the phrase to plain ASCII and remove any apostrophes. For example,Müller's algorithmmight becomeMuellers algorithm.
- Divide this result into words, splitting on spaces and any remaining
punctuation (typically hyphens).Recommended: if any word already has a conventional camel case
appearance in common usage, split this into its constituent parts (e.g.,AdWordsbecomesad words). Note that a word such asiOSis not
really in camel case per se; it defies any convention, so this
recommendation does not apply.
- Recommended: if any word already has a conventional camel case
appearance in common usage, split this into its constituent parts (e.g.,AdWordsbecomesad words). Note that a word such asiOSis not
really in camel case per se; it defies any convention, so this
recommendation does not apply.
- Now lowercase everything (including acronyms), then uppercase only the first
character of:… each word, to yieldUpperCamelCase, or… each word except the first, to yieldlowerCamelCase
- … each word, to yieldUpperCamelCase, or
- … each word except the first, to yieldlowerCamelCase
- Finally, join all the words into a single identifier.
- Recommended: if any word already has a conventional camel case
appearance in common usage, split this into its constituent parts (e.g.,AdWordsbecomesad words). Note that a word such asiOSis not
really in camel case per se; it defies any convention, so this
recommendation does not apply.
- … each word, to yieldUpperCamelCase, or
- … each word except the first, to yieldlowerCamelCase

Note that the casing of the original words is almost entirely disregarded.


Examples oflowerCamelCase:


*Acceptable, but not recommended.


For examples ofUpperCamelCase, uppercase the first letter of each correctlowerCamelCaseexample.


Note: Some words are ambiguously hyphenated in the English language: for examplenonemptyandnon-emptyare both correct, so the method namescheckNonemptyandcheckNonEmptyare likewise both correct.


## 7 JSDoc


JSDocis used on all classes, fields, and methods.


### 7.1 General form


The basic formatting of JSDoc blocks is as seen in this example:


```
/**
 * Multiple lines of JSDoc text are written here,
 * wrapped normally.
 * @param {number} arg A number to do something to.
 */
function doSomething(arg) { … }
```


or in this single-line example:


```
/** @const @private {!Foo} A short bit of JSDoc. */
this.foo_ = foo;
```


If a single-line comment overflows into multiple lines, it must use the
multi-line style with/**and*/on their own lines.


Many tools extract metadata from JSDoc comments to perform code validation and
optimization. As such, these commentsmustbe well-formed.


### 7.2 Markdown


JSDoc is written in Markdown, though it may include HTML when necessary.


Note that tools that automatically extract JSDoc (e.g.JsDossier) will often
ignore plain text formatting, so if you did this:


```
/**
 * Computes weight based on three factors:
 *   items sent
 *   items received
 *   last timestamp
 */
```


it would come out like this:


```
Computes weight based on three factors: items sent items received last timestamp
```


Instead, write a Markdown list:


```
/**
 * Computes weight based on three factors:
 *
 *  - items sent
 *  - items received
 *  - last timestamp
 */
```


### 7.3 JSDoc tags


Google style allows a subset of JSDoc tags. See??for the complete list. Most tags must
occupy their own line, with the tag at the beginning of the line.


Disallowed:


```
/**
 * The "param" tag must occupy its own line and may not be combined.
 * @param {number} left @param {number} right
 */
function add(left, right) { ... }
```


Simple tags that do not require any additional data (such as@private,@const,@final,@export) may be combined onto the same line, along with an
optional type when appropriate.


```
/**
 * Place more complex annotations (like "implements" and "template")
 * on their own lines. Multiple simple tags (like "export" and "final")
 * may be combined in one line.
 * @export @final
 * @implements {Iterable<TYPE>}
 * @template TYPE
 */
class MyClass {
  /**
   * @param {!ObjType} obj Some object.
   * @param {number=} num An optional number.
   */
  constructor(obj, num = 42) {
    /** @private @const {!Array<!ObjType|number>} */
    this.data_ = [obj, num];
  }
}
```


There is no hard rule for when to combine tags, or in which order, but be
consistent.


For general information about annotating types in JavaScript seeAnnotating JavaScript for the Closure CompilerandTypes in the Closure Type System.


### 7.4 Line wrapping


Line-wrapped block tags are indented four spaces. Wrapped description text may
be lined up with the description on previous lines, but this horizontal
alignment is discouraged.


```
/**
 * Illustrates line wrapping for long param/return descriptions.
 * @param {string} foo This is a param with a description too long to fit in
 *     one line.
 * @return {number} This returns something that has a description too long to
 *     fit in one line.
 */
exports.method = function(foo) {
  return 5;
};
```


Do not indent when wrapping a@descor@fileoverviewdescription.


### 7.5 Top/file-level comments


A file may have a top-level file overview. A copyright notice, author information,
and defaultvisibility levelare optional.
File overviews are generally recommended whenever a
file consists of more than a single class definition. The top level comment is
designed to orient readers unfamiliar with the code to what is in this file. If
present, it may provide a description of the file's contents and any
dependencies or compatibility information. Wrapped lines are not indented.


Example:


```
/**
 * @fileoverview Description of file, its uses and information
 * about its dependencies.
 * @package
 */
```


### 7.6 Class comments


Classes, interfaces and records must be documented with a description and any
template parameters, implemented interfaces, visibility, or other appropriate
tags. The class description should provide the reader with enough information to
know how and when to use the class, as well as any additional considerations
necessary to correctly use the class. Textual descriptions may be omitted on the
constructor. When defining a class@constructorand@extendsannotations are
not used with theclasskeyword unless it extends a generic class. When
defining an@interfaceor a@record, the@extendsannotation is used when
defining a subclass and theextendskeyword is never used.


```
/**
 * A fancier event target that does cool things.
 * @implements {Iterable<string>}
 */
class MyFancyTarget extends EventTarget {
  /**
   * @param {string} arg1 An argument that makes this more interesting.
   * @param {!Array<number>} arg2 List of numbers to be processed.
   */
  constructor(arg1, arg2) {
    // ...
  }
};

/**
 * Records are also helpful.
 * @extends {Iterator<TYPE>}
 * @record
 * @template TYPE
 */
class Listable {
  /** @return {TYPE} The next item in line to be returned. */
  next() {}
}
```


### 7.7 Enum and typedef comments


All enums and typedefs must be documented with appropriate JSDoc tags
(@typedefor@enum) on the preceding line. Public enums and typedefs must
also have a description. Individual enum items may be documented with a JSDoc
comment on the preceding line.


```
/**
 * A useful type union, which is reused often.
 * @typedef {!FruitType|!FruitTypeEnum}
 */
let CoolUnionType;
 
/**
 * Types of fruits.
 * @enum {string}
 */
const FruitTypeEnum = {
  /** This kind is very sour. */
  SOUR: 'sour',
  /** The less-sour kind. */
  SWEET: 'sweet',
};
```


Typedefs are useful for defining short record types, or aliases for unions,
complex functions, or generic types. Typedefs should be avoided for record types
with many fields, since they do not allow documenting individual fields, nor
using templates or recursive references. For large record types, prefer@record.


### 7.8 Method and function comments


In methods and named functions, parameter and return types must be documented,
even in the case of same-signature@overrides. Thethistype should be
documented when necessary. Return type may be omitted if the function has no
non-emptyreturnstatements.


Method, parameter, and return descriptions (but not types) may be omitted if
they are obvious from the rest of the method’s JSDoc or from its signature.


Method descriptions begin with a verb phrase that describes what the method
does. This phrase is not an imperative sentence, but instead is written in the
third person, as if there is an impliedThis method ...before it.


If a method overrides a superclass method, it must include an@overrideannotation. For overridden methods, all@paramand@returnannotations must
be specified explicitly even if no type from the superclass method is refined.
This is to align with TypeScript.


```
/** A class that does something. */
class SomeClass extends SomeBaseClass {
  /**
   * Operates on an instance of MyClass and returns something.
   * @param {!MyClass} obj An object that for some reason needs detailed
   *     explanation that spans multiple lines.
   * @param {!OtherClass} obviousOtherClass
   * @return {boolean} Whether something occurred.
   */
  someMethod(obj, obviousOtherClass) { ... }

  /**
   * @param {string} param
   * @return {string}
   * @override
   */
  overriddenMethod(param) { ... }
}

/**
 * Demonstrates how top-level functions follow the same rules.  This one
 * makes an array.
 * @param {TYPE} arg
 * @return {!Array<TYPE>}
 * @template TYPE
 */
function makeArray(arg) { ... }
```


If you only need to document the param and return types of a function, you may
optionally use inline JSDocs in the function's signature. These inline JSDocs
specify the return and param types without tags.


```
function /** string */ foo(/** number */ arg) {...}
```


If you need descriptions or tags, use a single JSDoc comment above the method.
For example, methods which return values need a@returntag.


```
class MyClass {
  /**
   * @param {number} arg
   * @return {string}
   */
  bar(arg) {...}
}
```


```
// Illegal inline JSDocs.

class MyClass {
  /** @return {string} */ foo() {...}
}

/** No function description allowed inline here. */ function bar() {...}

function /** Function description is also illegal here. */ baz() {...}
```


In anonymous functions annotations are generally optional. If the automatic type
inference is insufficient or explicit annotation improves readability, then
annotate param and return types like this:


```
promise.then(
    /** @return {string} */
    (/** !Array<string> */ items) => {
      doSomethingWith(items);
      return items[0];
    });
```


For function type expressions, see??.


### 7.9 Property comments


Property types must be documented. The description may be omitted for private
properties, if name and type provide enough documentation for understanding the
code.


Publicly exported constants are commented the same way as properties.


```
/** My class. */
class MyClass {
  /** @param {string=} someString */
  constructor(someString = 'default string') {
    /** @private @const {string} */
    this.someString_ = someString;

    /** @private @const {!OtherType} */
    this.someOtherThing_ = functionThatReturnsAThing();

    /**
     * Maximum number of things per pane.
     * @type {number}
     */
    this.someProperty = 4;
  }
}

/**
 * The number of times we'll try before giving up.
 * @const {number}
 */
MyClass.RETRY_COUNT = 33;
```


### 7.10 Type annotations


Type annotations are found on@param,@return,@this, and@typetags,
and optionally on@const,@export, and any visibility tags. Type annotations
attached to JSDoc tags must always be enclosed in braces.


#### 7.10.1 Nullability


The type system defines modifiers!and?for non-null and nullable,
respectively. These modifiers must precede the type.


Nullability modifiers have different requirements for different types, which
fall into two broad categories:

- Type annotations for primitives (string,number,boolean,symbol,undefined,null) and literals ({function(...): ...}and{{foo:
string...}}) are always non-nullable by default. Use the?modifier to
make it nullable, but omit the redundant!.
- Reference types (generally, anything inUpperCamelCase, includingsome.namespace.ReferenceType) refer to a class, enum, record, or typedef
defined elsewhere. Since these types may or may not be nullable, it is
impossible to tell from the name alone whether it is nullable or not. Always
use explicit?and!modifiers for these types to prevent ambiguity at
use sites.

Bad:


```
const /** MyObject */ myObject = null; // Non-primitive types must be annotated.
const /** !number */ someNum = 5; // Primitives are non-nullable by default.
const /** number? */ someNullableNum = null; // ? should precede the type.
const /** !{foo: string, bar: number} */ record = ...; // Already non-nullable.
const /** MyTypeDef */ def = ...; // Not sure if MyTypeDef is nullable.

// Not sure if object (nullable), enum (non-nullable, unless otherwise
// specified), or typedef (depends on definition).
const /** SomeCamelCaseName */ n = ...;
```


Good:


```
const /** ?MyObject */ myObject = null;
const /** number */ someNum = 5;
const /** ?number */ someNullableNum = null;
const /** {foo: string, bar: number} */ record = ...;
const /** !MyTypeDef */ def = ...;
const /** ?SomeCamelCaseName */ n = ...;
```


#### 7.10.2 Type Casts


In cases where the compiler doesn't accurately infer the type of an expression,
and the assertion functions ingoog.assertscannot remedy it, it is
possible to tighten the type by adding a type annotation comment and enclosing
the expression in parentheses. Note that the parentheses are required.


```
/** @type {number} */ (x)
```


#### 7.10.3 Template Parameter Types


Always specify template parameters. This way compiler can do a better job and it
makes it easier for readers to understand what code does.


Bad:


```
const /** !Object */ users = {};
const /** !Array */ books = [];
const /** !Promise */ response = ...;
```


Good:


```
const /** !Object<string, !User> */ users = {};
const /** !Array<string> */ books = [];
const /** !Promise<!Response> */ response = ...;

const /** !Promise<undefined> */ thisPromiseReturnsNothingButParameterIsStillUseful = ...;
const /** !Object<string, *> */ mapOfEverything = {};
```


Cases when template parameters should not be used:

- Objectis used for type hierarchy and not as map-like structure.

#### 7.10.4 Function type expressions


Terminology Note:function type expressionrefers to a type annotation for
function types with the keywordfunctionin the annotation (see examples
below).


Where the function definition is given, do not use a function type expression.
Specify parameter and return types with@paramand@return, or with inline
annotations (see??). This includes
anonymous functions and functions defined and assigned to a const (where the
function jsdoc appears above the whole assignment expression).


Function type expressions are needed, for example, inside@typedef,@paramor@return. Use it also for variables or properties of function type, if they
are not immediately initialized with the function definition.


```
/** @private {function(string): string} */
  this.idGenerator_ = googFunctions.identity;
```


When using a function type expression, always specify the return type
explicitly. Otherwise the default return type isunknown(?), which leads to
strange and unexpected behavior, and is rarely what is actually desired.


Bad - type error, but no warning given:


```
/** @param {function()} generateNumber */
function foo(generateNumber) {
  const /** number */ x = generateNumber();  // No compile-time type error here.
}

foo(() => 'clearly not a number');
```


Good:


```
/**
 * @param {function(): *} inputFunction1 Can return any type.
 * @param {function(): undefined} inputFunction2 Definitely doesn't return
 *      anything.
 * NOTE: the return type of `foo` itself is safely implied to be {undefined}.
 */
function foo(inputFunction1, inputFunction2) {...}
```


#### 7.10.5 Whitespace


Within a type annotation, a single space or line break is required after each
comma or colon. Additional line breaks may be inserted to improve readability or
avoid exceeding the column limit. These breaks should be chosen and indented
following the applicable guidelines (e.g.??and??). No other whitespace is allowed in type
annotations.


Good:


```
/** @type {function(string): number} */

/** @type {{foo: number, bar: number}} */

/** @type {number|string} */

/** @type {!Object<string, string>} */

/** @type {function(this: Object<string, string>, number): string} */

/**
 * @type {function(
 *     !SuperDuperReallyReallyLongTypedefThatForcesTheLineBreak,
 *     !OtherVeryLongTypedef): string}
 */

/**
 * @type {!SuperDuperReallyReallyLongTypedefThatForcesTheLineBreak|
 *     !OtherVeryLongTypedef}
 */
```


Bad:


```
// Only put a space after the colon
/** @type {function(string) : number} */

// Put spaces after colons and commas
/** @type {{foo:number,bar:number}} */

// No space in union types
/** @type {number | string} */
```


### 7.11 Visibility annotations


Visibility annotations (@private,@package,@protected) may be specified
in a@fileoverviewblock, or on any exported symbol or property. Do not
specify visibility for local variables, whether within a function or at the top
level of a module.@privatenames may optionally end with an underscore.


## 8 Policies


### 8.1 Issues unspecified by Google Style: Be Consistent!


For any style question that isn't settled definitively by this specification,
prefer to do what the other code in the same file is already doing. If that
doesn't resolve the question, consider emulating the other files in the same
package.


### 8.2 Compiler warnings


#### 8.2.1 Use a standard warning set


As far as possible projects should use--warning_level=VERBOSE.


#### 8.2.2 How to handle a warning


Before doing anything, make sure you understand exactly what the warning is
telling you. If you're not positive why a warning is appearing, ask for help
.


Once you understand the warning, attempt the following solutions in order:

- First, fix it or work around it.Make a strong attempt to actually
address the warning, or find another way to accomplish the task that avoids
the situation entirely.
- Otherwise, determine if it's a false alarm.If you are convinced that
the warning is invalid and that the code is actually safe and correct, add a
comment to convince the reader of this fact and apply the@suppressannotation.
- Otherwise, leave a TODO comment.This is alast resort.
 If you do this,do
not suppress the warning.The warning should be visible until it can be
taken care of properly.

#### 8.2.3 Suppress a warning at the narrowest reasonable scope


Warnings are suppressed at the narrowest reasonable scope, usually that of a
single local variable or very small method. Often a variable or method is
extracted for that reason alone.


Example


```
/** @suppress {uselessCode} Unrecognized 'use asm' declaration */
function fn() {
  'use asm';
  return 0;
}
```


Even a large number of suppressions in a class is still better than blinding the
entire class to this type of warning.


### 8.3 Deprecation


Mark deprecated methods, classes or interfaces with@deprecatedannotations. A
deprecation comment must include simple, clear directions for people to fix
their call sites.


### 8.4 Code not in Google Style


You will occasionally encounter files in your codebase that are not in proper
Google Style. These may have come from an acquisition, or may have been written
before Google Style took a position on some issue, or may be in non-Google Style
for any other reason.


#### 8.4.1 Reformatting existing code


When updating the style of existing code, follow these guidelines.

- It is not required to change all existing code to meet current style
guidelines. Reformatting existing code is a trade-off between code churn and
consistency. Style rules evolve over time and these kinds of tweaks to
maintain compliance would create unnecessary churn. However, if significant
changes are being made to a file it is expected that the file will be in
Google Style.
- Be careful not to allow opportunistic style fixes to muddle the focus of a
CL. If you find yourself making a lot of style changes that aren’t critical
to the central focus of a CL, promote those changes to a separate CL.

#### 8.4.2 Newly added code: use Google Style


Brand new files use Google Style, regardless of the style choices of other files
in the same package.


When adding new code to a file that is not in Google Style, reformatting the
existing code first is recommended, subject to the advice in??.


If this reformatting is not done, then new code should be as consistent as
possible with existing code in the same file, but must not violate the style
guide.


### 8.5 Local style rules


Teams and projects may adopt additional style rules beyond those in this
document, but must accept that cleanup changes may not abide by these additional
rules, and must not block such cleanup changes due to violating any additional
rules. Beware of excessive rules which serve no purpose. The style guide does
not seek to define style in every possible scenario and neither should you.


### 8.6 Generated code: mostly exempt


Source code generated by the build process is not required to be in Google
Style. However, any generated identifiers that will be referenced from
hand-written source code must follow the naming requirements. As a special
exception, such identifiers are allowed to contain underscores, which may help
to avoid conflicts with hand-written identifiers.


## 9 Appendices


### 9.1 JSDoc tag reference


JSDoc serves multiple purposes in JavaScript. In addition to being used to
generate documentation it is also used to control tooling. The best known are
the Closure Compiler type annotations.


#### 9.1.1 Type annotations and other Closure Compiler annotations


Documentation for JSDoc used by the Closure Compiler is described inAnnotating JavaScript for the Closure CompilerandTypes in the Closure Type System.


#### 9.1.2 Documentation annotations


In addition to the JSDoc described inAnnotating JavaScript for the Closure Compilerthe following tags are common
and well supported by various documentation generation tools (such asJsDossier) for purely documentation purposes.


Not recommended.


Syntax:@author username@google.com (First Last)


```
/**
 * @fileoverview Utilities for handling textareas.
 * @author kuth@google.com (Uthur Pendragon)
 */
```

### 9.2 Commonly misunderstood style rules


Here is a collection of lesser-known or commonly misunderstood facts about
Google Style for JavaScript. (The following are true statements; this is not a
list ofmyths.)

- Neither a copyright statement nor@authorcredit is required in a source
file. (Neither is explicitly recommended, either.)
- There is nohard and fastrule governing how to order the members of a
class (??).
- Empty blocks can usually be represented concisely as{}, as detailed in
(??).
- The prime directive of line-wrapping is: prefer to break at a higher
syntactic level (??).
- Non-ASCII characters are allowed in string literals, comments and JSDoc, and
in fact are recommended when they make the code easier to read than the
equivalent Unicode escape would (??).

### 9.3 Style-related tools


The following tools exist to support various aspects of Google Style.


#### 9.3.1 Closure Compiler


This program performs type checking and
other checks, optimizations and other transformations (such as lowering code to
ECMAScript 5).


#### 9.3.2clang-format


This program  reformats
JavaScript source code into Google Style, and also follows a number of
non-required but frequently readability-enhancing formatting practices. The
output produced byclang-formatis compliant with the style guide.


clang-formatis not required. Authors are allowed to change its output, and
reviewers are allowed to ask for such changes; disputes are worked out in the
usual way. However, subtrees may choose to opt in to such enforcement locally.


#### 9.3.3 Closure compiler linter


This program  checks for a
variety of missteps and anti-patterns.


#### 9.3.4 Conformance framework


The JS Conformance Framework is a tool that is part of the Closure Compiler that
provides developers a simple means to specify a set of additional checks to be
run against their code base above the standard checks. Conformance checks can,
for example, forbid access to a certain property, or calls to a certain
function, or missing type information (unknowns).


These rules are commonly used to enforce critical restrictions (such as defining
globals, which could break the codebase) and security patterns (such as usingevalor assigning toinnerHTML), or more loosely to improve code quality.


For additional information see the official documentation for theJS Conformance Framework.


### 9.4 Exceptions for legacy platforms


#### 9.4.1 Overview


This section describes exceptions and additional rules to be followed when
modern ECMAScript syntax is not available to the code authors. Exceptions to the
recommended style are required when modern ECMAScript syntax is not possible and
are outlined here:

- Use ofvardeclarations is allowed
- Use ofargumentsis allowed
- Optional parameters without default values are allowed

#### 9.4.2 Usevar


vardeclarations are scoped to the beginning of the nearest enclosing
function, script or module, which can cause unexpected behavior, especially with
function closures that referencevardeclarations inside of loops. The
following code gives an example:


```
for (var i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
  var iteration = i;
  setTimeout(function() { console.log(iteration); }, i*1000);
}

// logs 2, 2, 2 -- NOT 0, 1, 2
// because `iteration` is function-scoped, not local to the loop.
```


Even thoughvardeclarations are scoped to the beginning of the enclosing
function,vardeclarations should be as close as possible to their first use,
for readability purposes. However, do not put avardeclaration inside a block
if that variable is referenced outside the block. For example:


```
function sillyFunction() {
  var count = 0;
  for (var x in y) {
    // "count" could be declared here, but don't do that.
    count++;
  }
  console.log(count + ' items in y');
}
```


For global declarations where theconstkeyword would be used, if it were
available, annotate thevardeclaration with@constinstead (this is
optional for local variables).


#### 9.4.3 Do not use block scoped functions declarations


Donotdo this:


```
if (x) {
  function foo() {}
}
```


While most JavaScript VMs implemented before ECMAScript 6 support function
declarations within blocks it was not standardized. Implementations were
inconsistent with each other and with the now-standard ECMAScript behavior for
block scoped function declaration. The ECMAScript 5 standard and prior only
allow for function declarations in the root statement list of a script or
function and explicitly ban them in block scopes in strict mode.


To get consistent behavior, instead use avarinitialized with a function
expression to define a function within a block:


```
if (x) {
  var foo = function() {};
}
```


#### 9.4.4 Dependency management withgoog.provide/goog.require


WARNING:goog.providedependency management is deprecated.All new files,
even in projects usinggoog.providefor older files, should usegoog.module. The following rules are for
pre-existinggoog.providefiles only.

- Place allgoog.provides first,goog.requires second. Separate provides
from requires with an empty line.
- Sort the entries alphabetically (uppercase first).
- Don't wrapgoog.provideandgoog.requirestatements. Exceed 80 columns
if necessary.
- Only provide top-level symbols.

goog.providestatements should be grouped together and placed first. Allgoog.requirestatements should follow. The two lists should be separated with
an empty line.


Similar to import statements in other languages,goog.provideandgoog.requirestatements should be written in a single line, even if they
exceed the 80 column line length limit.


The lines should be sorted alphabetically, with uppercase letters coming first:


```
goog.provide('namespace.MyClass');
goog.provide('namespace.helperFoo');

goog.require('an.extremelyLongNamespace.thatSomeoneThought.wouldBeNice.andNowItIsLonger.Than80Columns');
goog.require('goog.dom');
goog.require('goog.dom.TagName');
goog.require('goog.dom.classes');
goog.require('goog.dominoes');
```


All members defined on a class should be in the same file. Only top-level
classes should be provided in a file that contains multiple members defined on
the same class (e.g. enums, inner classes, etc).


Do this:


```
goog.provide('namespace.MyClass');
```


Not this:


```
goog.provide('namespace.MyClass');
goog.provide('namespace.MyClass.CONSTANT');
goog.provide('namespace.MyClass.Enum');
goog.provide('namespace.MyClass.InnerClass');
goog.provide('namespace.MyClass.TypeDef');
goog.provide('namespace.MyClass.staticMethod');
```


Members on namespaces may also be provided:


```
goog.provide('foo.bar');
goog.provide('foo.bar.CONSTANT');
goog.provide('foo.bar.method');
```


WARNING:goog.scopeis deprecated.New files should not usegoog.scopeeven in projects with existinggoog.scopeusage.


goog.scopemay be used to shorten references to namespaced symbols in code
usinggoog.provide/goog.requiredependency management.


Only onegoog.scopeinvocation may be added per file. Always place it in the
global scope.


The openinggoog.scope(function() {invocation must be preceded by exactly one
blank line and follow anygoog.providestatements,goog.requirestatements,
or top-level comments. The invocation must be closed on the last line in the
file. Append// goog.scopeto the closing statement of the scope. Separate the
comment from the semicolon by two spaces.


Similar to C++ namespaces, do not indent undergoog.scopedeclarations.
Instead, continue from the 0 column.


Only make aliases for names that will not be re-assigned to another object
(e.g., most constructors, enums, and namespaces). Do not do this (see below for
how to alias a constructor):


```
goog.scope(function() {
var Button = goog.ui.Button;

Button = function() { ... };
...
```


Names must be the same as the last property of the global that they are
aliasing.


```
goog.provide('my.module.SomeType');

goog.require('goog.dom');
goog.require('goog.ui.Button');

goog.scope(function() {
var Button = goog.ui.Button;
var dom = goog.dom;

// Alias new types after the constructor declaration.
my.module.SomeType = function() { ... };
var SomeType = my.module.SomeType;

// Declare methods on the prototype as usual:
SomeType.prototype.findButton = function() {
  // Button as aliased above.
  this.button = new Button(dom.getElement('my-button'));
};
...
});  // goog.scope
```


Prefer to usegoog.requireTypeinstead ofgoog.forwardDeclareto break
circular dependencies between files in the same library. Unlikegoog.require,
agoog.requireTypestatement is allowed to import a namespace before it is
defined.


goog.forwardDeclarestatements must follow the same style rules asgoog.requireandgoog.requireType. The entire block ofgoog.forwardDeclare,goog.requireandgoog.requireTypestatements is
sorted alphabetically.


goog.forwardDeclareis used in legacy code to break circular references
spanningacross library boundaries. This pattern however is poorly supported
by build tools and should not be used. Code should be organized to avoid
circular dependencies across libraries (by splitting/merging libraries).


If agoog.providefile depends on agoog.modulefile, thegoog.providefile can not normally refer to the module's exports via a global name. Instead,
in addition togoog.require()ing the module, thegoog.providefile must
fetch the module's export object by callinggoog.module.get('module.name').


Note: Only callinggoog.module.get('module.name')does not create a build-time
dependency of your code on the module. Thegoog.requireis needed for the
build dependency.


WARNING:goog.module.declareLegacyNamespaceis only for transitional use.


goog.module.declareLegacyNamespaceis only for use while migrating a
JavaScript file and its consumers fromgoog.providetogoog.module. Update consumers of
yourgoog.moduleto usegoog.modulethemselves.
Remove calls togoog.module.declareLegacyNamespacewhenever possible.


If you can't update consumers of a legacy namespace fromgoog.providetogoog.modulesoon, please wrap the contents of your file in a call togoog.scope, usegoog.module.getto import the legacy namespace--and then
delete the call togoog.module.declareLegacyNamespacein yourgoog.module.


Callinggoog.module.declareLegacyNamespace()inside agoog.module(name)will
declare the module's namespace as a global name just like agoog.provide()call does. This allows a nongoog.modulenamespace to access the module's
exports without callinggoog.module.get(name).
